I work professionally as an interior designer, so I expect to make most of the decisions regarding layout and decor for the shared spaces. While I don't plan on ""bringing the party home,"" I am very social and would probably be out most of the time post-covid. I am extremely clean and would expect the same from my roommate - meaning no dishes in the sink and cleaning up after yourself always.

To keep it short, my partner and I signed a lease to rent a unit with a washer and dryer. Two weeks before we are to move in, the management company lets us know they aren‚Äôt able to order the appliances by the time we move in because they are sold out and they‚Äôre not sure when they will be in stock. They offer to  put in white ones (brand not specified and won‚Äôt match the other stainless steel appliances) or pay for a laundry expenses until they are able to order the correct units. At first, I was all for getting expenses covered, but then I thought further about it and am not satisfied with that. From my perspective, we are paying a rate that is commensurate with an apartment that includes a washer and dryer in unit. We also have no guarantees the appliances will come in a reasonable amount of time. While of course it is perhaps reasonable for management to cover laundry expenses, I think the fairer option is to temporarily reduce the rent for the period that we are without the appliances. Does this seem fair to anyone? Also, has anyone had experience seeking rent reductions based on appliance issues similar to mine? Please let me know and thanks!",2020-12-23 23:01:12

Hi everyone, I'm looking for 1 more person to sign onto a year lease for this awesome first floor apartment. The available room has direct access to the lovely backyard.There is access to the building's roof, which is amazing on fourth of July. We also have a dishwasher and microwave in the kitchen.

The place is in between the Morgan and Jefferson L train stops and is only a 7 minute walk to the Morgan stop. Very close to Maria Hernandez Park and all of the bars/restaurants (House of Yes, Mominette, Los Hermanos, etc.) off the Jefferson stop as well.

The super is currently fixing up the apt and it will come unfurnished (ie the bed won't be there!)

About me, I'm a early 30s man who works as a camera operator. The other roommate is mid 20s woman who works from home.

When I'm not working I enjoy reading, and talking about movies/art. I like to have a clean home but I'm very chill and easy to talk to. I have a 4 yr old border collie who is super smart and will play fetch with you forever, or until you loose interest.

I'm looking for roommates who are clean and can pay rent on time.

I also am friends  with the other first floor apt (musician/artist, web designer and bartender). They are all awesome people, and they have a matching border collie who would share our backyard.I am showing the apartment everyday.

If you're interested message me with a little about you, and the times you're available to see the apt. Thanks!

Should I?,2,kiekab,https://www.reddit.com/r/NYCapartments/comments/kiekab/advice_moving_to_manhattan_from_flushing_should_i/,11,"I am currently paying about $2500 for a 750 sq ft condo with balcony in Flushing in Sky View Parc Apartments. Living on top of a mall means getting to BJs, Target etc is basically walking downstairs. Also, the place has a great dog run. It‚Äôs got an okay gym as well. The commute when the offices open would be about 40-45 minutes.

The Manhattan option is in Midtown, is about 650-700 sq ft, and has a smallish balcony. Gross rent is about 2750. Grocery would be a walk to relatively expensive options like Whole Foods or taking a cab to a BJs or a Costco I guess. The gym is about an extra 160 bucks a month on-premises or finding a gym outside (no idea what those prices look like). No close by dog park means walking your dog around the block on weekdays.

Huge apartment perfect for relaxing in a pandemic. Your bedroom is spacious, the main room is full of windows with plenty of space to work from home, and a 200 sf back patio for fresh air. There's a dishwasher and laundry right at home. We share the shower, but otherwise the bathroom is all yours. You've got a walk in closet and we share three closets in the main space.

It's very quiet. I never hear the neighbors and there's virtually no street noise. We're 5 mins from the Myrtle/Broadway JMZ and 8 mins from the Morgan Ave L. There's a park two blocks away.

I‚Äôm a civil engineer in my mid/late 20s. Before we all wore masks, I played Ultimate frisbee and loved hanging out at Happy Fun Hideaway, dancing at Nowadays on Sunday afternoons, and having friends over for board game night. Now that we‚Äôre stuck inside, my wild and crazy hobbies include taking care of my plants, decorating for the holidays, and napping in a hammock in the backyard.

I‚Äôm looking for a roommate who‚Äôs on the same page about avoiding coronavirus like it‚Äôs the plague and keeping the apartment tidy. My engineering license requires me to keep my nose clean, so please no drugs in the apartment. I‚Äôm down for a new friend, but it‚Äôs also cool if you prefer to keep to yourself.

Would prefer someone who's looking to stay long-term, but short-term is also possible.

No smoking indoors, but fine outside. Unfortunately no couples or pets, sorry.Let me know if you have any questions at all!

We have a room opening up on Jan 16th, figure I post on reddit.

This is a 4-bedroom, 2 full-bathroom and 2 half-bathroom duplex apartment in a great location in Greenpoint... Super close to both McCarren and McGolrick Park.

We are three mid to late 20s males looking for a fourth roommate to hop onto the lease with us. Our lease goes thru September.

All three of us are very laid back and are looking for the same from our potential new roommate.

As for the room itself it is on the smaller side, but you can definitely fit a full sized mattress and a desk in there. You will have a half bathroom all to yourself and will only share the shower with one other person (myself). We have laundry in-unit and we have a really nice backyard. If you're interested check out our listing and feel free to reach out to me with any questions!

Starting back in July, I would hear scratching noises in the walls. I put it down to the walls settling or wires hitting the outside wall until I heard squeaking and realized the noise stopped once I hit the wall. 

I told my landlord, and he kept telling me it was nothing- either the wires (which he moved) or someone's AC (which doesn't make sense since I'm the highest apartment). 

I ended up buying those ultrasonic noise makers that plug into the wall, and it was okay up until last Friday. Now the noise is coming from the wall in the closet (there's no plug there). And to make matters worse, my roommate saw a mouse. 

We told our landlord same day, who hasn't even come up to the apartment to check it out yet, and we haven't seen any visible holes.

It‚Äôs mutually beneficial for sure but a blessing to me nonetheless.

Now back to the topic- for people interested in renting a luxury apartment unit in Long Island City, Brooklyn, or Manhattan (west side) - we can both get at least $1,000 (up to $2000 depending on unit / timing)

TFC apartment buildings are all luxury buildings and they are in:

-MANHATTAN: Chelsea, Financial District, Midtown West, Hudson Yards, Murray Hill, UES. West Village

-BROOKLYN: Downtown (Dumbo / Heights)

-QUEENS: Long Island City

I get $2,000-$4,000 in rent credit for every friend I refer to a rental unit at TF Cornerstone (any building location).

Once I get my credit- I‚Äôll split it and give you $1,000 or $2,000 depending on eligibility! Keep in mind- you can‚Äôt go through a broker in order to get the referral bonus so please apply without one! It‚Äôs easy! You go to the leasing office, ask for a tour of any of the available units and a leasing agent will give you a tour. If you like a unit- then put me down as the referring party when you submit an application. I‚Äôll come down to say hi if I‚Äôm home or we can grab a coffee!

After incentives (2-3 free months) - you can find a studio for well under $2k, or a big 1 bedroom for ~$2300 a month!! Or a 2 bedroom for under ~$3500 a month. On top of that- you‚Äôll get $1,000-$2,000 from me which with all things considered- makes for a very very sweet deal even considering COVID. There are no bs fees, broker fees, etc. In fact, the security deposit is $1k as long as you have decent credit.

Feel free to check their website (TFC.com) for available units all over NYC

My partner and I are looking at an apartment complex on the UWS that‚Äôs on Amsterdam Avenue.  The complex has been newly constructed (2018) and is managed by Pinnacle City Living.  I know Pinnacle is a nationwide company that manages more than 100K units, but does anyone here have any experience with their NYC management?  Our apartment complex is really new so there aren‚Äôt many reviews of it, but Pinnacle has bad reviews on Google and that‚Äôs worrying me.

Admittedly, few people ever leave positive reviews for their landlord and there‚Äôs just 11 reviews and they could be about non-NYC properties. But first-hand experiences from someone here would be the best thing for us before we commit to this lease.

58,[advice] Mouse issue and management need to open wall to fix water leakage downstair,3,kgcxuj,https://www.reddit.com/r/NYCapartments/comments/kgcxuj/advice_mouse_issue_and_management_need_to_open/,2,"We are coming toward the later part of our lease (ends April 2021). The apartment is on the ""older"" end when we moved in which we were ok with it. However, the building complex has a huge rat issue and manifested to mice in the apartment. We personally hired an exterminator to plug up all visible holes in our apartment, yet Mickey would come out to party every night even if there is NO FOOD that is reachable to them. The smell of dead mice appears every so often by the sink, where we suspect there's a gap between the cabinet and the wall with an opening. Also, management never really addressed to remedy the issue when reached out via email or phone. 

Our latest issue is there's water leakage from our bathroom to the downstairs neighbor. They had tried to fix what is visible, but the problem lies inside the wall. Because our bedroom and bathroom share the same wall, they want to open up our bedroom wall to find out where's the leak and try to fix it. Our concern is once the walls are open, all hell will break loose and it will take them at least 2-3 days to fix and sealed up the wall again? The leakage has been an ongoing issue for our downstairs neighbor. 

TLTR: Because of a mice issue and potential opening up our bedroom wall to fix a problem downstairs.  Is it wise to negotiate to end our lease early, ask them to pay for our moving expenses so they can do whatever the hell they want to fix whatever issues? Any thoughts on how I should approach this?

[**EDIT 12/23: originally this post listed move-in date as Jan 1, but because of tightening Covid restrictions in my roommate‚Äôs home country she has to delay her flight, and the move-in date has been pushed to late January‚Äî 1/25 or after. We can be flexible!]

You'd have the bigger room of the two, which features two huge/tall windows, classy gray walls (but go ahead and paint them whatever color you like), and a closet.  My current roommate is (sadly) returning home, but she is leaving all of her bedroom furniture, and the price for all of it is negotiable! It features a great desk/chair (awesome if you WFH!), a dresser, bed and frame, mirror, and maybe a plant!

I'm going to be moving at the end of March, so this could be perfect for couples who want a two-bedroom at that time, or if you're a single person who wants the adventure of a new roommate come April.

Deposit is $850, rent per month is $1425.

I love this apartment -- so much that I've lived here for over 6 years! It's pre-war and has tons of character. I have the main spaces pretty well-covered for furniture and decor, so it could be a great option if you don't have much of that. There's also a BIG back porch where you can do yoga or live your best gardening life. No elevator, but there's only 1 flight of stairs.  Utilities are not included, but split between us usually run $100-ish a month.

I like to create a calm, welcoming, supportive atmosphere -- like an oasis to come back to after a long day. Come check it out!

**About You:**

I'm just looking for someone respectful of personal space and private time. So... just be clean (clean enough.. I'm not totally insane about it), kind, don't throw large ragers (but feel free to live your best ""board game night"" life), if you smoke just please do it outside, and... yeah! Generally, please just be a responsible adult and we'll get along fine. Bonus points if you enjoy watching Rachel Maddow, Handmaid's Tale, or enjoy making solid TV suggestions ;)  If you have a dog, we can talk! My cat has never lived with one, but if you know your doggo is good around cats, let's chat!  Ideally, I'd like someone to live here for at least 3 months, after which point you can take over the lease or find a new place!

**About Me:**

I'm a pretty laid-back girl who likes to cook, bake (I have a Kitchenaid!), enjoy a glass of scotch at the end of a long workday, roller skate, and sleep in on the weekends. I don't party hard in the apartment. It's like a little oasis and I'd love to keep it that way (though the occasional get-together is totally cool). I'm the kind of person who would never leave you stranded with 2 squares of toilet paper or an empty ice cube tray.

I edit for a production company and I work from home full time right now, but I keep my headphones on (quiet for you + quiet for me!). Sometimes I record voice over in my closet, and sometimes I do some light digital marketing. In non-COVID times I lead short adventure trips outside the city for groups of people on the weekends, and I play roller derby. Now that I'm home a lot, I do a lot of Zoom workouts with my team and Zoom yoga classes. Zoom zoooom.

Also, I have a cat named Franklin D Purrsevelt and he will totally snuggle on your lap (he has lived with cats before and is pretty chill about it, so if you have a cat that plays well with others, or a new kitten, that's cool.) I'm all about respecting each others' space. I'd be down to hang out together and play board games, but I also need my alone time and will totally respect yours.

**About the Neighborhood:**

This apartment is in prime Park Slope! Within a single block's radius are lots of restaurants, a laundromat, a grocery store, a wine store (love them!!), and anything else you could really need. Down the street is Barclay's Center with a lot of great transportation options. It's generally pretty low-key with lots of people strolling around on the weekend. Prospect Park is a 10-minute walk away, perfect if you like to run, check out a farmer's market, or meet some friendly doggos.

It is unlikely that we will find something before lease expires, (middle of December). We have already paid the entire month of Decemnber.

Rent is $825/month + utilities ($65-$95/month depending on season - this includes everything). You would be taking over my lease ending July 31, and signing a new one August 1.

My roommate has his own secluded living room and bedroom area behind double doors, and he keeps to himself. This is the quietest apartment I‚Äôve ever lived in, with a lot of privacy, decent amount of space, and beautiful view of the backyard, which you have full access to. Your living room has a closet, and there is hall space for a few additional belongings. The couch is included free of charge, because it won‚Äôt fit out the door. It was purchased two years ago and has been used infrequently. Full sized mattress, bed frame, and dresser are also all two years old, in great condition, and available for purchase if interested. TV also available for purchase if interested.

The rent is much lower than other places in the area, because the home has been in one family for generations and they are fair about the cost. Rent hasn‚Äôt increased since I moved in, and I‚Äôm on my third lease with them. The only downside is the landlord does use a real estate company, so you‚Äôll have to pay an application fee and the broker fees (which I will split with you to make it less cost prohibitive) to move in, in addition to first, last, and security. However, this is just for the lease - the landlord will deal personally with you for any other issues, and is very responsive.

The apartment is in the middle of the block on 19th Street between 5th and 6th Avenues. It's 4 blocks from the R train, 2 blocks from the laundromat, and there's easy street parking available on the block.

I can show the room virtually and/or in person if you‚Äôd like (with masks and all). Feel free to reach out with any questions!

78,[Advice] Random question- who is responsible for window blinds?,1,kf9v29,https://www.reddit.com/r/NYCapartments/comments/kf9v29/advice_random_question_who_is_responsible_for/,6,"Hi! 

I‚Äôll be moving into a middle income restricted and rent controlled studio on January 1st, as long as everything continues to go as well as it has been. The unit is currently empty and was just renovated like a month ago. It‚Äôs my first apartment on my own. 

I didn‚Äôt look for it while touring the place, but on the StreetEasy 3-D tour, which was set up mid-renovation, I noticed that the window unit doesn‚Äôt have any blinds. I‚Äôm currently in my first ever apartment with roommates that I took over from a former tenant, and the window already had blinds- and the blinds were here when the former tenant moved in, too. 

Is it a landlord‚Äôs responsibility to provide blinds for the window(s), or do tenants buy blinds? Window treatments aren‚Äôt usually cheap, especially for larger windows (this one is), but it‚Äôs usually an investment for homeowners (my parents remind me of this whenever I play with the blind strings in their house lol). But I‚Äôm just a temporary year to year tenant of an apartment owned by someone else, so why would I invest in blinds, when they won‚Äôt fit my next apartment when I eventually move? 

Hope this makes sense! Obviously I‚Äôll buy blinds if it‚Äôs the tenant‚Äôs responsibility, but I feel like it‚Äôs a basic that should come with the apartment..",2020-12-18 03:16:32

80,(Advice) Small claims court for security deposit,4,kep5qy,https://www.reddit.com/r/NYCapartments/comments/kep5qy/advice_small_claims_court_for_security_deposit/,10,"In April of this year, my roommate lost her job because of the pandemic. She was a server at a local restaurant. 

After she lost her job, we started looking into whether we were going to keep our apartment or move out. We first needed to know if our landlord was going to increase the rent if we renewed. 

After calling our landlord again and again with no answer, I ended up writing them a letter asking if we could review the new lease as we were deciding if we were going to renew. 

The landlord mailed me back a letter including the new lease for review. 

By May, my roommate and I made the decision to not renew the lease. Without her income coming in, we simply could not afford the place. We had been in contact with the landlord and communicated  over the phone we would be moving out when our lease was up on June 30. 

We ended up moving out 1 month before our lease was up (i.e June 1). When we moved out, we arranged to give our super our keys, etc. We asked about our security deposit and our super advised us to speak to the landlord. 

A month goes by and we hear nothing about the security deposit. We reach out to the landlord about the lease and finally get a hold of them by phone. The landlord is suddenly very confused and claims they didn‚Äôt know we were moving out so they ‚Äúdecided to keep the security deposit.‚Äù

We wrote a demand letter saying we need an itemized receipt per NY law of what they are keeping from our deposit and why. They responded by mail saying that they were ‚Äúunder the impression we were staying in the apartment because we asked to review the lease‚Äù and because of that they are keeping the deposit. 

(Obviously, my roommate and I were confused/mad/upset because we had multiple conversations with our landlord, confirmed we were moving, arranged with the landlord/super to give back our keys AND paid a month of rent for an apartment that was vacant since we moved out prior to our lease date) 

We ended up filing a case with small claims court to get our security deposit back. 

I‚Äôm wondering if anyone has any advice or experience with going to small claims court for a security deposit. What‚Äôs the best way to prepare? 

To this day, the landlord never provided an itemized receipt on our security deposit. 

I have the following documents:
- Screenshots of our multiple calls with them 
- amended lease (I don‚Äôt have the original lease but I have the last lease I signed)
- screenshots of past tenants claiming the landlord kept their deposit (found from a website that rates landlord) 

Also, now I realize I should‚Äôve had a paper trail of us confirming we were moving out. I‚Äôve lived in many nyc apartments and haven‚Äôt had this issue before. I know next time to get everything in writing.",2020-12-17 06:21:15

You would sign onto the lease extension that starts February 1, 2021 that would be $1196 per month.

The apartment:The top floor (on the 1st floor of the building) has two bedrooms, two bathrooms, a large living room (with high ceilings and huge windows), a separate dining room/office, and a large kitchen. Downstairs has two bedrooms including the available bedroom, a third bathroom, a washer and dryer (just for our apartment!), and the door to our own outdoor patio area with a grill, table and chairs.

The bed currently in the room can remain and possibly the other furniture in the room.

The location:Around West 101st Street and Broadway. Very close to the 1/2/3 trains in a quiet neighborhood. We are less than two avenues away from Riverside Park and a 5-10 minute walk to Central Park. Plenty of grocery stores nearby, include a Whole Foods just a few blocks away.

You, Future Roommate:Very easy going, tidy, responsible, friendly and financially secure. We are also open to the right dog if they are very chill. This apartment has been a relaxing home where we hang out and, before COVID, would have occasional cookouts or game nights.

92,[Advice] Question about subletting,10,kds2ue,https://www.reddit.com/r/NYCapartments/comments/kds2ue/advice_question_about_subletting/,1,"
Hi there,

Have some questions about NYC regulations around subletting...hoping someone can give be advice. I live in a doorman building Manhattan, I think it's a condo/condoop. I've been a tenant in this unit since June 2019 and have a good relationship with my landlady. My lease is due to end May 2021.

I'll get to the point:

1.  The building is owned by ""Big NYC Landlord"" (fake name)
2. The unit itself is owned by an individual landlady that I pay directly
3. I am looking to sublet the unit for the final 2 months of my lease, and I have a potential candidate
4. The building has a ""minimum lease length of 6 months"" policy
5. However, in this case, my thinking I would still be the tenant on the lease, and the sublet agreement is purely between me and the sublet, and not my landlady nor ""Big NYC Landlord"" -- thus, I don't think this would be in violation of point #4
6. My understanding is that NYC regulations only restrict for sublets that are ""less than 30 days"" (e.g., anti-AirBnB)



My questions:

1. If I and my landlady agree to have this subletter, then is it true that the sublease agreement is **only between myself and the subletter, and NOT with the building?**
2. If #1 is true, then the subletter would not be signing a lease agreement with the building, and thus
3. The subletter is ""exempt"" from this ""6 months minimum"" policy (in point #4 above)


Just wanted someone to gut check me on this...thanks in advance!",2020-12-15 22:06:22

My partner and I are moving to the city from January 1 and looking for an apartment in the UWS right now.  

We were connected to a broker (at one of the major firms: think Sotheby‚Äôs, Douglas Elliman etc.). We had a call with the broker and she just sent us a list of 5 properties she had curated for us.

Independently, I have been looking on StreetEasy, Facebook Marketplace, here (and other places) as well and found several places.  Before my broker sent me her curated list, I had reached out to some StreetEasy listings and their agents as well.  At least 3 of the 5 places the broker sent us aren‚Äôt the agency‚Äôs exclusives: I have found them online as well.  A couple of them are no-fee listings (but the broker‚Äôs PDF for me didn‚Äôt mention that and I‚Äôm told this is something the customer must be vigilant about).

At this point, I would love advice on how to proceed further because I don‚Äôt fully know the etiquette/decorum around these things.

-	Could I reach out to the listing agent for 1 of those properties myself or would the listing agent not like that?

I've been in my apartment for two years now and about to renew. The rent is/was at fair market value (no complaints). Beginning next month, the landlord has offered a 10% discount to renew for a year. Definitely not shabby, but part of me thinks I should ask for more. Which would you decide and why?

\-1- Accept 10% off as it's already a good deal right now given the apartment was at fair market value pre-Coronavirus.

\-2- Accept the 10% off but ask them to renovate my bathroom, which is in need of quite a bit of work and would at least be a tax-deductible capital improvement for them.

\-3- Ask for an additional 5% off the rent (i.e., a 15% decline).

\-4- Ask for the first month of my renewal lease free. I think this is a ridiculous idea as it is quite a bit steeper than #3 in terms of net effective rent decrease (8.5%), but a friend of mine claims that this is more palatable for the landlord as then my stated rent is higher? I know this is true for new leases, but I didn't think it would be for existing tenants.

Thank you.",2020-12-15 05:49:33

-We had an infestation of rats early in the pandemic. We‚Äôre on the first floor and there‚Äôs a few restaurants on our block. Rats made entry into the building and got into my apartment as it faces the street. I needed another person to help me lift base boards, seal the walls and lay traps, he refused to help me. I had no tools to work around the heater and he wouldn‚Äôt even lend me a toolkit. He told me he was to busy to assist.

There was a problem with these rats for nearly a month. We asked him to lay additional traps near the entrances to the building and the basement. We noticed nothing was being done and our landlord reached out to the management company, who were unaware there was an issue because the super never reported it. 

One of our neighbors told us he has too much pride to admit there was an issue. 

-I asked him if I could borrow a snow shovel to dig out my car this week if we get a significant amount of snow fall and he won‚Äôt let me borrow it. 

The is the first bad experience I‚Äôve had with a super. In my last apartment, the super had a list outside his door, you wrote down your issue and he‚Äôd get to it in a day or so. In my current place, he can‚Äôt be bothered to help anyone with anything. 

I‚Äôm wondering what to do here. I‚Äôm staying at least another year. We‚Äôve always tipped the super around the holidays, but should I even bother when every-time I‚Äôve asked him for assistance, he‚Äôs given me an excuse or refused to help?",2020-12-15 02:02:07

I have had to be the middleman between them, but now my roommate is threatening to withhold rent due to a promised amenity not being completed for a while given the covid situation. I'm tired of being the middleman and being in the apartment in general. While I like my roommate, I want to move for mental health reasons as the stress and anxiety of everything is starting to affect me physically. I requested to be taken off of my lease (without mentioning the mental health aspect), but was told by my landlord that he does not alter leases that are in progress. I then mentioned the mental health aspect and further offered to pay my share of the rent (7 months) in advance to show him that he would not be losing any money from me being taken off (I'm in a fortunate enough position that I had the money saved to be able to offer this). He has not responded to multiple notes about this and I'm assuming at this point he is just ignoring me. I am considering moving and just giving my roommate the rent money each month until he can find an alternate roommate. 

I have a few main questions: 

1. Is there any sort of legal action I can take to have my landlord take me off the lease?

2. If an eviction were to be filed against us, could I pay off my share of the owed rent or have it not appear on my record on the grounds that I wasn't living there at the time?

3. If we get evicted for non-rent reasons (ex. violating the lease by subletting), can I have it not appear on my record on the grounds that I wasn't living there at the time?

Thanks!

I currently live in a two bedroom on the LES of Manhattan. I signed a lease September 1st 2020 for one year. Now that I am living here and working from home I‚Äôve realized this isn‚Äôt the more desirable place for me because of a few reasons:

1. The neighbors above my bedroom fight every single night. It is loud and hard to sleep through. I‚Äôm up early for work, work long hours, and losing my sleep is becoming exhausting, physically and mentally.
2. The upstairs neighbors also blast their music at bizarre hours- mentally draining because I feel like it‚Äôs never quiet. I‚Äôve made 311 calls and my roommate called the police once about a domestic violence occurrence one night.
3. The space is small- I thought work would stay open for on-site but it closed, so the small space wouldn‚Äôt bother me considering that I‚Äôd be out and about. It‚Äôs getting to me and I‚Äôm paying a decent amount.

I want to leave. End of story. Between the noise and the space. I‚Äôve also come to a conclusion that it‚Äôs time for me to live alone. I‚Äôve been with roommates my whole life. So the other dilemma is- if I do leave before the end of my lease I‚Äôll probably end up hurting my roommate (who is also my friend and somewhat clung to me). My roommate would then be left living with a stranger in this small space, working and living.

I‚Äôve asked management to lower my rent- no response. No fixing of the noise. Also forgot to mention the blood in my stairwell that hasn‚Äôt been cleaned. Management stated I could leave but I‚Äôd had to forfeit my deposit. If I leave then whoever comes in next gets a lower rent.

Could I skip paying a month of rent without serious consequences? I‚Äôm Not being provided with a healthy and mentally wound living environment. I‚Äôve received no answer confirming a lowering of my rent.

Thank you so much!

And if you suggest I do leave for my own sanity, how do I approach my friend about living alone? She will be hurt.",2020-12-14 03:26:31

Hi everyone, I'm looking for 1 more person to sign onto a year lease for this awesome first floor apartment. The available room has direct access to the lovely backyard.   
There is access to the building's roof, which is amazing on fourth of July. We also have a dishwasher and microwave in the kitchen.

  
The place is in between the Morgan and Jefferson L train stops and is only a 7 minute walk to the Morgan stop. Very close to Maria Hernandez Park and all of the bars/restaurants (House of Yes, Mominette, Los Hermanos, etc.) off the Jefferson stop as well.

   
The super is currently fixing up the apt and it will come unfurnished (ie the bed won't be there!)  
About me, I'm a early 30s man who works as a camera operator. When I'm not working I enjoy reading, and talking about movies/art. I like to have a clean home but I'm very chill and easy to talk to. I have a 4 yr old border collie who is super smart and will play fetch with you forever, or until you loose interest. 

  
I'm looking for roommates who are clean and can pay rent on time.

  
I also am friends  with the other first floor apt (musician/artist, web designer and bartender). They are all awesome people, and they have a matching border collie who would share our backyard.  


I am showing the apartment everyday. If you're interested message me with a little about you, and the times you're available to see the apt. Thanks!",2020-12-13 20:11:27

I am new to the renting scene in NY. I looked over a few places and found a good one in Hells Kitchen and plan on putting in a deposit tomorrow.

There was a clause in the lease about lease assignment (finding someone else to take over my lease, if I have move out in before my lease term) that constitutes a $1500 fee, and upon mentioning that in case of work or something I definitely have to, the agent mentioned that they are foregoing that in times of COVID but that won't be specified in the lease because they can't make a change on the lease form it seems (some legal procedure and is how it is for a Blumberg lease)

Originally I was going for the place for 2.5 months so it gave me 1) enough time to see if I like it and subsequently 2) find a lease.

Looking for someone to takeover my room for only $770/month. The room is on the second floor of a 3-unit building in the North Historic District of Crown Heights. I lost my job due to COVID-19, and I am looking for someone to take over this room either on December 15 or the first of January, until the lease ends on April 30, 2021 (with the option to renew).

The apartment is only a 5-minute walk from the C train (Kingston-Throop), a 10-second walk from the closest B43 bus stop,  a 10-minute walk from the 2, 3, and 4 train (Kingston Avenue), and less than a 10-minute walk from the LIRR (Nostrand Ave).

The building resides right off Atlantic Avenue close to many independent shops, discount stores, fully stocked grocery stores, tasty Jamaican restaurants, adorable bodegas, and clean laundromats.

About the room:

The room is in a 4bd, 1 bathroom unit. I've never had a problem waiting for the bathroom. The medium-sized room features a huge deep-set window facing the street for remarkable natural lighting. It also features a ceiling fan, a spacious closet, and hardwood flooring.

The room is $770/month, not including the internet, electricity, or gas. However, the utilities are split among everyone, and on average, your portion for the utilities would not exceed $70 each month.

About the unit:

While the unit does not have a traditional common area, it does feature a full-size stainless-steel kitchen with a dishwasher, a full-size luxury-style bathroom with a skylight and ample space, and newly installed hardwood floors.

You will be sharing this unit with three genuinely nice roommates (two female, one male); the women are in their late-20s, the male is in his late 30s. Everyone keeps to themselves, but no one is opposed to having a conversation!

Your room is only up a couple of sets of stairs: one outside of the building, and one inside of your apartment. It can fit quite a bit of furniture, but most comfortably fits a full-sized or queen-sized bed.",2020-12-07 21:20:40

The super was no where to be found and eventually the fire department had to come in and knock down my upstairs neighbors door.

Originally thought the sink had over flowed , but found her ceiling had collapsed ( this is the top floor apartment) over the past week my kitchen ceiling fell in , and has been raining water . Everyone in this line of apartments (5th-1st floor) now has fallen kitchen ceilings and heavy water flow . Management has been unresponsive and the only progress is the water fall stopped 6 days later .

I still have a 3 foot wide hole in my ceiling ( my kitchen is unusable). And no ETA on repairs or rent adjustments.

At this point I want to be bought out of my lease , clearly the lack of continued maintenance is a push out of tenants . Has anyone ever initiated a lease buy out or legal action?",2020-12-07 16:06:52

The super basically didn't want to do anything. He's like my job is to make sure heat is provided (for other things please contact your owner), I have 225 apts to take care of I don't have time blabla. 

The best they did is insert a piece of wood underneath one pipe to help the water flow back down so that it doesn't bump into the hot steam which was causing the noise. 

But this issue is serious, the banging still exists and wakes me up three times in the middle of the night. 

Now I found the noise is coming from behind the wall. Do anyone have any suggestion what I could do to fix this? Thank you very much!

* No upstairs neighbors, above us is a rarely used public outdoor terrace
* Very close walk to the 7, N, R, F, M, E, and G. Queensboro Plaza, Queens Plaza, Court Square, and Queensbridge Station are all within a couple blocks of us. There is a bike path that goes straight over the Queensboro Bridge.

**The building**

* The friendliest door-people :)
* Laundry room
* Game room with pool table
* 3 public outdoor spaces, some with grills, games, pingpong
* Gym, yoga room, outdoor gym
* Work room with rentable conference rooms
* Reservable movie theater
* Management is very no-nonsense. No amenity fee, issues are addressed promptly, and they mostly stay out of the way.

We absolutely love it here and wouldn't move out of the building except the pandemic has changed our situation. We're open to virtual or in-person tours for serious inquiries. Please let me know if you're interested!

Looking for a roommate to share a beautiful Greenpoint McGolrick parkside duplex. Your room is upstairs at the back of the apartment, gets lovely light and has direct access to a semi-private fenced backyard. My room is downstairs, at the front of the apartment and we would share the living room, kitchen and bathroom (shower with great water pressure!). Looking for someone friendly, tidy and chill that takes the pandemic seriously and is responsible during their contact with people. I have asthma so I take it very seriously but I do understand the need to move about doing one's business.

The room: Large bedroom with comfy queen sized bed, bedside table, bookcase and chest of drawers. One double wide closet and one single closet, both with lofted storage - loads of room for your things. Two windows and windowed door to backyard patio. Gets lots of light, especially in the afternoon. Very quiet and peaceful place to hang out. Open to rearranging furniture as it suits your needs (for instance in the pictures there is a table where the bookcase is now...) Eero beacon in room with strong wifi signal.

About me: I am a 44 year old woman currently studying photography. I enjoy making photos, drawing, sewing, cooking clean meals, reading, good conversation and exercising. I am tidy but not a neat freak, although I do find it much easier to relax in a home that is maintained at a higher level of cleanliness (I usually pick up every night \[kitchen clean/common areas tidied\], do a regular clean once a week and a deep clean every 6-8 weeks).

My ideal roommate: You are communicative, willing and open to talk should living styles clash. No need to build up resentment when we're all adults and can hash it out respectfully. Likes to socialize together sometimes but also enjoys time alone. Respects privacy of each other's food/things/spaces and is considerate of keeping common areas clear of clutter. Willing to discuss upping Covid precautions should case levels rise severely. I do not have friends over for long periods of time and I'm certainly not hanging out in large groups without masks indoors or out.

LGBTQ+ supportive and 420 friendly, no cats (allergic, I'm sorry!), open to discussion about dogs. Cigarette smokers welcome, however NO smoking inside - you can step right outside into the backyard if you need a smoke.

DM if interested, thanks for reading!

Hello!!!

&#x200B;

I am looking for someone to sublease my room for $900 per month, from Jan 1 2021 to July, 31 2021. You have the option to sign onto the lease past that period!  

&#x200B;

The room is very large, has exposed brick and a closet. It has it's own entrance into our backyard, which only our apartment has access to. There are big windows, so there's a lot of natural light. 

 There is a dishwasher in the apartment, central air and we have two bathrooms.  In the building there is a washer and dryer.   

You will be living with 4 other roommates:  

female, 26 (social worker, currently working remotely) 

female, 21 (retail worker) 

female, 21 (retail worker) 

female, 36 (retail worker)   

We all enjoy hanging out with each other, drinking, watching TV or dancing! We are a laid back but organized house, as we have a chore chart which we update monthly and have a monthly house meeting. (Although the house meeting usually just becomes a roommate hangout).   

&#x200B;

We have been taking precautions for COVID 19 including wearing masks when leaving the apartment, getting tested if we think we've been exposed to the virus and limiting the amount of people we let into our home.   Cats and small dogs welcome!!!!!",2020-12-04 20:56:29

They broke up a month after her moving in and signing the lease and now they live in seperate bedrooms when we talked about having an extra room in the process. The thing is I recently went through a break up and was semi absent for a couple months, and in the process of me bringing all my stuff back we got in a big fight about dishes and I was treated like I was invading on their apartment, and words were exchanged and it almost turned into a fist fight. fast forward to now (2 or so months later) we still don't talk and it's very uncomfortable. I asked the landlord what I can do and he told me I have to find a replacement (obviously right?) but he can't/won't do anything to break my lease or move me somewhere else. 

I have I think 3-4 months left on the lease but I just want to get out of it if there's any way.

Lease ends Feb 28th but is easily renewable. Details below:

\- True 1-bed with separate (large) kitchen and living room.- Bedroom is extra spacious and currently fits a queen sized bed, Ikea Hemnes dresser, a tall dresser, coat rack, and nightstand. I don't have it configured optimally, but you could fit a second desk in the bedroom if needed.- Living room is large and fits a bookshelf, desk, 86"" couch, TV/stand, reading chair, and kitchen table. There are also built-in shelves as well.- The location is amazing - the apartment is between Black Seed Bagel and Butcher's Daughter, right above a laundromat, and within a 5-minute walk to the 6, B/D/F/M, J/Z, and r/W subway stops.- The only con is that it's a railroad-style apartment, and the living room doesn't get much sunlight during the day.

I've truly loved living here for the past couple of years and hope someone else is able to enjoy the space as well. The only reason why I'm leaving is because I'm moving in with my partner and we need more space (wfh indefinitely). Reach out with any questions or to see the place.

I'm hoping to stay at least a few years and am on a somewhat tight budget. Would you:

1) Go for rent stabilized to lock in a decent price now before the market recovers

2) Go for bigger savings in a non-rent stabilized unit, since the market won't recover any time soon

* I'll be starting a new job in Manhattan sometime Q3 2021, so I anticipate having to find a place by then.
* My income will be $130K base + $45K bonus = $175K gross annually.
* I'm a graduating student, so I'm not as familiar with the finer details of income and rent (though I have read a few of the helpful guides here).

A few questions:

* Is $3K /mo total = $1.5K /mo per roommate a fairy tale for a 2-bedroom in Manhattan even mid-pandemic?
* Is  $6K /mo total = $3.0K /mo per roommate living outside of my means? I imagine in NYC the difference between gross and actual income is larger  than elsewhere.
* Anyone want to room with me üòä?",2020-11-29 05:43:17

She is Eastern European and 10 years older than me with a steady job. Starting in July she started saying racist anti-black things that made me uncomfortable. (I am a white-passing mixed person who is not black but many of my friends are and racism makes me deeply uncomfortable.) She then revealed herself to be a conspiracy theorist about COVID-19. Today she sent me an article that was a breath from NeoNazi propaganda. I was trying to just get through the lease despite being uncomfortable but this was the last straw. 

I‚Äôm scared, I am at a loss and I don‚Äôt want to act impulsively. I am expecting a raise in December that would allow me to move out mid-January/February 1. Has anyone dealt with a shitty subletter? How do you break the bad news?",2020-11-29 04:40:51

223,"[Room Share] $650/month in bay ridge. One Bedroom, Street-Overlooking. 2 Roomies currently.",4,k2xbhi,https://www.reddit.com/r/NYCapartments/comments/k2xbhi/room_share_650month_in_bay_ridge_one_bedroom/,0,"Hey! This is Brian & Pete, we still have not filled this room since posting back in October, so this is a re-post in many ways. We're two artists looking to get a third roommate to fill in for a previous roomie who had to leave due to a family hospice situation. We're pretty content to keep to ourselves, but are also both generally chill and quiet people. We live in a 3br/1ba apartment located above a store in Bay Ridge. The rent for the room is $650/mo, plus utilities (which averages out to about 100 bucks most months per person.) A December move-in would be ideal.


The Room is facing the street, unfurnished, but the second largest bedroom in the apartment. I (Brian), lived in that room the first few years I was in NYC; it is large enough to comfortable fit a twin mattress, a desk, and other basic furniture (see link/attached photos if I can figure out how to attach photos). It can, also fit a queen mattress in an exceptionally cramped way, but if you're into that it is possible. There is a radiator heater, and it is the furthest room from the two of us so you'll have an additional bit of privacy from the two of us going about our days. It is living room adjacent, but we're not really hosting parties or anything like that for obvious reasons.


The Apartment itself is rather large, specifically the living room and dining area. The kitchen is really more of a kitchenette, but it suits our purposes well enough. We're located a few blocks from the R-Train, two blocks from grocery stories, next door is a bodega which has most things; its a pretty decent location for getting what you need and where you need.


About us; we're a couple of mid-late queer individuals who are ostensibly looking to get out of NYC within a year or so. If you want a starter apartment situation in the city, this is your chance; we're open-minded, LGBTQ+ friendly, and we're taking COVID-19 seriously; as in addition to normal reasons I've lost several people to it already and just don't have time for bold fools or fascists clogging up our bandwidth.

Tl;dr:

Rent - $650/month.
Utilities - ~$100/month.
Security Deposit - $650.
Ideally we want someone for a good while, and we'll give ample notice (like, 3 months notice) if we plan on getting out of NYC. I'm graduating from grad school next summer, so our earliest out would be Autumn-ish 2021; and that's assuming the world isn't as on fire still. If you just want to pop in for a few months while something else gets figured out, we'd appreciate a 3-month minimum commitment.


Landlord wants a W-2, proof of income, and/or credit report (any 2 should do.)

226,[Advice] What‚Äôs reasonable for me to get security deposit back?,12,k2vxtz,https://www.reddit.com/r/NYCapartments/comments/k2vxtz/advice_whats_reasonable_for_me_to_get_security/,15,"My spouse has been in the apartment for 11 years. She‚Äôs definitely done more than wear and tear the place (before we got married and I moved in). Lots of holes, ceiling light fixtures changed, multiple creatively painted walls, a lifetime‚Äôs worth of gardening stuff (planters, pots, supplies) in the back yard.

Ordinarily I‚Äôd say we‚Äôre not likely to get much if any security deposit back without a lot more work than we can probably handle (we bought and need to fix up the new one). But for the past 4 years or so, every unit in our building‚Äôs been getting fully renovated as old tenants move out: new kitchen, bathrooms, appliances, paint, etc.

**What‚Äôs reasonable for me/us to do to get our security deposit back? Or what can I safely not do and not have it matter?**

(Other context, possibly relevant? We asked for a 3 month extension to accommodate the buying process and they said it had to be 6 months minimum. 2 months out I reminded them we‚Äôd be leaving and management said we‚Äôd pay a two month penalty to break lease. I said no chance in hell we‚Äôd pay after telling them very clearly that we‚Äôd be out by end of year. So they backed down.)

(Edit, other context 2: I don‚Äôt know if they‚Äôll actually do it, but the other thing to know is the place probably needs several walls redone. We had a pipe leak inside a wall and two other leaks from above damage other walls, and they never repaired them properly. One was half assed and another was never  addressed because it still ‚Äúlooked okay‚Äù, though damaged enough for a shelf to fall off it.)",2020-11-29 00:20:44

 I moved into my apartment on November 1st for a 7 month lease. I've been unemployed since June and finally got a job offer that starts on Monday. The only thing is is that it's located in NJ so I'd have to break my lease in order to do the commute. My landlord knew about my unemployment status and was fine with it because I was getting unemployment and  helping out at my brother's shop while finding work. I told him about the job offer and that I'll have to move and asked him about the possibility of getting the security deposit back or maybe using it towards December's rent. 

He said that, as per lease terms, he needed to be given a 30 days notice in order to find a new tenant if I wanted the deposit back. So I said that I'll pay for December's rent and move out at the end of the month so that he can get 30 days to find someone and I can get my deposit. He's really adamant on me still paying the entire month's rent, moving someone in asap, and then giving me the full deposit only after checking the countertops and wooden floors for scratches. 

I do not want to and do not think it's fair for me to pay a whole month's rent and move out 1 or 2 weeks later if he manages to find someone.  We just texted and he said that he already listed my room on multiple sites. Please tell me honestly (but preferably not brutally) if I'm being unreasonable here.

Edit: forgot to mention that the landlord also never signed the lease which is sitting in my bedroom drawer. He also never did a credit score check or background check on me and doesn't have any of my information other than my phone number. He normally rents out the whole place (3br/1bath) but decided to rent the rooms out individually in hopes of getting tenants more easily.",2020-11-28 05:33:19

She will be starting at a position making \~60k while I will be completing a short (2 month) program during which I will not be making an income and will be looking for a job afterwards. I have \~50k in savings in the bank and we both have very good credit. 

I am concerned my lack of income will make it difficult for us get approved for an apartment. I am very confident that I will be able to get hired within a few months, but I know that won't mean anything to landlords now. 

I know about the 40x income guidelines, but am very unfamiliar with the rental market in New York, especially what it is currently like with the pandemic. Is it unrealistic to expect to be approved for an apartment that is, say, \~2k a month without a guarantor, or is using a guarantor likely our only option? Will my savings be able to compensate for not currently having an income? Is there anything we can do to put ourselves in the best position to get approved?

Sorry for all of the questions, but we just really don't know the landscape of the NYC rental market. Thanks for any help you can give.",2020-11-21 00:00:19
269,"[LOOKING FOR] AVAILABLE DEC 1 -- Roommate for sunny room in 3 bedroom, 2 bathroom in Clinton Hill ($950)",2,jxvtl6,https://www.reddit.com/r/NYCapartments/comments/jxvtl6/looking_for_available_dec_1_roommate_for_sunny/,0,"Hi! I have an open room available in my lovely apartment in Clinton Hill starting on December 1. The place is really spacious and sunny and has been great for remote working during the pandemic. PLUS it includes in-unit washer and dryer (!) in a separate laundry room, as well as a fully furnished kitchen WITH a dishwasher.  


The available room is $950 and has a beautiful skylight that gets great light throughout the day.  


The neighborhood: The apartment is located right on the border of Clinton Hill and Bedstuy on a super charming quiet, tree-lined street just steps away from amazing restaurants and bars like Mekelburg's, Izzy Rose, and Chilo's. It's just a short jaunt from Fort Greene park, and a few blocks from the G train as well as the A/C.  


About me: I'm a late-twenties journalist who for the time being is working at home due to COVID. I live in the master bedroom with a separate bathroom, so you'll be sharing the other bathroom with just one other roommate, a fellow twentysomething lady working in media. I'm very chill and relaxed, and during pre-pan times, I'm usually out and about hanging with friends or exploring the city (though have been trying to continue do so safely in some capacity in these trying times!) I also have a very sweet cat named Zora, who loves to cuddle. While I think I'd prefer no additional pets, I'm open-minded to the possibility.  


You'd be signing a one-year lease, though there may be some flexibility on duration of stay. The landlords are a young couple that live next door and have honestly been the best landlords I've had thus far in New York. To move in, they'd like one month's security deposit + one month's rent, and will likely ask for a recent paystub/credit check for proof of income. Utilities usually come out to about $100/month.

275,(Advice) Rent Stabilization - Preferential Rent??,16,jxkt68,https://www.reddit.com/r/NYCapartments/comments/jxkt68/advice_rent_stabilization_preferential_rent/,11,"Hey everyone, 

I just signed a rent-stabilized lease for a studio apartment in the Lower East Side. The price was settled at $1,450, which I felt great about because it‚Äôs my first Manhattan apartment, and with the rent stabilized deal it feels like a place I‚Äôll be able to settle in for years to come. However, upon going over the paperwork (specifically, the included rent stabilized rider), I noticed something called ‚Äúpreferential rent‚Äù, and that was listed as being $2,000. I‚Äôd never heard of the term preferential rent prior to that, and I did ask about it at the time of signing‚Äîthe gentleman told me to simply ignore it, that the apartment was simply rented last year for $2,000, and that it has no influence on the price we agreed on, including when it‚Äôs renewal time. He was very kind and helpful throughout the showing and signing, and I sincerely felt he was being truthful and not someone doing dishonest business. 

It was only after signing the lease and going home that I started researching this preferential rent thing. And now I‚Äôm more confused than ever‚Äîboth as to what it means in general, and how it specifically pertains to me and my future as a tenant in this new apartment. The worst part is, the more I look into it, the more worried I‚Äôm becoming about what I actually agreed to sign. 

My main question right now is: When it comes time to renew next year, will they try to charge me the preferential price of $2,000 and base the yearly increase off of that? I haven‚Äôt even moved in and I‚Äôm already nervous about the possibility of that happening, since that would mean there‚Äôs no way I could re-sign, and by that time the market should be doing better which means I won‚Äôt find anything else in the $1,450 range (AKA: bye bye to my Manhattan five year plan). I‚Äôm really hoping it‚Äôs just me being paranoid and overly cautious, and that come next year I‚Äôll only be paying slightly more than the $1,450 price we started at. That was the arrangement I had in mind when agreeing to this apartment, and I did receive verbal confirmation that this was indeed the deal. 

If anyone here has experience with rent stabilization and knows more about preferential rent in regards to my situation, please reach out. I hope I didn‚Äôt sign off on a deceptive deal...

312,[Advice] Finding apartments that accept vouchers just seems impossible.,34,jv81ml,https://www.reddit.com/r/NYCapartments/comments/jv81ml/advice_finding_apartments_that_accept_vouchers/,15,"I‚Äôm sure that the demographics of this sub may not have experienced issues with housing vouchers but any advice will help. 

The voucher is called cityfheps. You can only obtain this voucher if you‚Äôre in a homeless shelter. The voucher pays up to $800 for a room, $1200 for a studio or one bedroom. The landlord will receive an incentive of $4300 for housing a tenant. Now it does seem like a great deal but a lot of landlords are not accepting the voucher because of inconsistent payments of rent from HRA. There‚Äôs a blog with landlord complaints about how terrible the voucher is https://www.nycfheps.com/ . 

My friend is currently looking for a place that accepts the voucher. However due to their credit and the fact most landlords don‚Äôt accept the voucher. I truly want my friend to find a place, but I tell them to not rely on the voucher. They want a good place to live (less than 30 minutes from the city, nice neighborhood). Those places are quite expensive to live in and I doubt any landlords will accept the vouchers if they know they can get a tenant that fits their criteria. 

I tried explaining this to my friend but they believe they have the right to be picky. I totally understand but realistically in NYC it‚Äôs a dog eat dog world out there for apartments. I told them I believe being picky atm is not really option. I respect the ambition but also as a life long New Yorker, sometimes you just gotta take the L. I told them to just fuck the voucher and save up ( I live with my folks for this very reason and hoping to save enough money have my own apartment ). They are literally frustrating themselves and finding apartments in NYC is hard enough. My uncle is landlord and he stopped accepting the vouchers too because of inconsistent payments and hard time kicking out tenants. 

I also have a best friend who also went through the shelter system with a young child. They did eventually get a place after 2 years. But it was in the pj‚Äôs and it‚Äôs not the best but it‚Äôs a roof over their head. My bff also gave me insight on how the system really is. As DV and single parents have preferences over single people with no kids. Also that being picky is not an option because almost any apartment HRA is able to assign to you is better than staying in a dangerous shelter. 

I tried. I reached out to realtors I know but no avail. I truly want to help my friend but I am at loss for words. It would make sense for us to live together since I‚Äôm planning to leave my folks home next year and be roomies but they are not to keen on that idea. 

So if anyone in this sub knows of any landlords/realtors that are okay working with people with vouchers or know of any housing programs or have any insight on other options please feel free to comment.",2020-11-16 17:53:55

My husband and I were both laid off and I got a new job out of state. Trying to fill my huge Windsor Terrace apartment for Jan - June. LL may allow you to sign 1 year agreement with him if you wanted to lock it in.

This has been a good, solid apartment. Lots of space for working out, entertaining, cooking. The outdoor space has bee a godsend with covid. We are 4 blocks to Prospect Park off the F/G at 15th Street. 

$2000 available Jan 1 unfurnished

Details:
- ground floor (NOT garden or basement) with private entrance (0 stairs) - no shared with anyone else
- 4 huge closets (seriously, the one by the door will easily fit bikes, the coat closet is 6 feet deep)
- living room is 13x15 - has sectional, recliner, huge bar, workout gear, cat tree, bookshelf.
- kitchen is 8.5x14 with brand new dishwasher and stove (replaced in August). We have tons of shelves in here and its been my office as well
- bedroom is 11x15 with large closet and door to patio. Could fit a king bed!
- private patio, we have a grill and smoker and lights. Neighbor to left is never ever ever outside, neighbor to right very rarely. It really is private! 
- pet friendly
- Easy street parking (we have had a car for all 5 years we lived here)
- concrete walls, you never hear the neighbors

Forgive the pictures, the apartment is messy and I took them yesterday when it was gloomy)

Happy to do video walk thru or in-person as long as we wear masks.

Not my first choice, but I am at a crossroads and don't have time to hunt for a ""home."" So it was appealing to snag a convenient, efficient studio. The place I was looking at offered me a very attractive net effective rent. I got approved fairly easily. Then I found out the way they achieve that net effective rent is by wiring me money to subsidize the monthly rent. In this case, upon signing, they are going to wire me $10,500. Immediately this raised my taxes spidey sense. I contacted my accountant, who said it might not be an issue if they don't plan to send a 1099. I wrote back to the leasing company and a WEEK LATER, they finally said I should consider it taxable income and that I would get a 1099. 

There's no way around this, right? I would just immediately owe an extra $4,000+ or something come tax season. I can see both sides of the argument. It is cash that I coooould do whatever with, but I am giving it right back to them for rent. 

If I am the first prospective tenant to ask this question, I wonder how pissed people are going to be when they get that 1099. 

Has anyone gone through this?",2020-11-12 23:55:08

It is a pre-war building located in the back of the building on the ground floor, overlooking the garden. The Garden is a shared space, but everything in the space belongs specifically to this unit. A small fire pit, with couches, grill, table, lights everything needed for a nice space. The neighbors rarely ever use it. We also have roof top access, and are less than a block from numerous cafe's and restaurants. The apartment is a 3 bedroom one bath. Your room is not connected to any of the other rooms and is definitely the largest, and most quiet. We also have two cats who mind their own business and are very well kept. 

This is a month to month sublease. You're more than welcome to stay as long as you like and we do not require a security deposit. All we ask is if you plan on moving out giving us some notice so we can prepare to find a new roommate. 

About us:

Me- 29, former software developer. I manage a restaurant in the West Village 7 days a week. I'm gone most days either working on side projects or at the restaurant. I'm very laid back and just ask for respect for our things as we take a lot of time making this place feel like home for all of us. 

Nick - 23, software developer. Works from home. Usually leaves right after he's done with work to go bike or climb. Rarely in the house after work. He has the two cats, and spends a lot of weekends upstate climbing. That'll probably change with the weather though.

We've lived together for 3 years now and have a good working relationship in the apartment. We were classmates in college, and former coworkers so we have no drama here and like to keep everything on the table if there are any issues. 

About you:

Can pay rent on time. Clean up after yourself. Pitch in here and there, and do whatever you want. We welcome anyone in here. I've never had a bad experience with finding roommates on reddit so I highly doubt you'll be an issue. 

I can supply pictures on request if you're interested in seeing the place and I can also have you come by for a viewing. I will edit this post later to supply pictures as well. Let me know if you have any questions!",2020-11-11 20:54:25

353,[Advice] I'm forcefully breaking my lease after my building was shot up with bullets. What's the worst case scenario here?,52,jrnueb,https://www.reddit.com/r/NYCapartments/comments/jrnueb/advice_im_forcefully_breaking_my_lease_after_my/,13,"Looking for unofficial advice. The property management company of my building (its a small two-apartment building) was allowing a tenant to completely rent out the entire apartment below me through AirBnB.

During the pandemic, people were having massive parties. I complained about the noise a lot and the fact that it was a risk to my roommate, who is a brain cancer survivor. Last month though a party of 30+ people ended with a gun shooting inside the stairwell of my building.I told the property manager that I was moving out as soon as I find a place, and he was understanding, but now a month later he has come back and said his bosses said no to breaking a lease.

The request was a formality. I will be moving out. I can't live here anymore as I'm scared to go outside and am frankly pissed that my complaints went unheard. Is the worst case scenario that I have to go to housing court and appear in front of a judge? What are my chances of convincing a housing court judge that I was put in great risk during the pandemic? I have collected evidence over the last couple of months documenting all of these things.",2020-11-10 19:17:40
354,Advice needed: Buying furniture!,7,jrnlmv,https://www.reddit.com/r/NYCapartments/comments/jrnlmv/advice_needed_buying_furniture/,3,"So I'm moving to NYC for a year, and since a year will go by pretty fast, I'm wondering if buying furniture (and then selling it again after a year) will be worth it or not, both financially as well as in terms of time and hassle. I'm wondering if anyone has any suggestions about how to go about this, or if there are any options that I should consider (is furniture rental a thing?). Is it easy to come by cheap (but also aesthetic) furniture?

On the professional side I have been a black car dispatcher for going on 13 years now. Since I have very unique job I have never had difficulty finding employment even in times like this. I've been with my current company for 4 years now. They've sent me to Las Vegas to train a team of dispatchers there and have kept me employed remotely throughout this pandemic. For the foreseeable future I'm working from home 3pm to 11pm most days and 12 hour shifts on the weekend. It's a quiet job that I do very well and at most I would require a direct Ethernet connection in order to work properly as I've been issue two internet phones that need direct Ethernet access and it wouldn't hurt for my laptop to be directly plugged in to the internet either.

On the personal side I'm a standard nerd. 34, Very meek, quiet, and only boisterous in situations where we're all having fun. I drink rarely, I'd prefer 420 friendly but it isn't a requirement for my life. As far as nerdy stuff goes I follow wrestling feuds, paint miniatures, play video games, and have an extensive board game collection that has helped me stay sane in this pandemic. I have a small group of friends and rarely if ever have them over. Pre-pandemic we mostly did a monthly boardgame Meetup at the Tribecca Whole Foods. I cook often and have a ""leave only footprints"" approach to cooking in that I clean almost immediately and tend to keep a very clean home. I'd like it if we were friends because I'm trying to stay somewhere at least a couple of years as I'm taking tests for the MTA and various other city agencies that would assure me a job with more upward mobility.

No pets but I don't mind them and would absolutely love to help care for them if you have any.

LGBTQ+ friendly and socially liberal, these days you can't be too open about this sort of thing.

I'm only looking to pay 800$ a month plus any utilities we split, you're more than welcome to the things I cook, and I am extremely tidy and will clean if allowed. I have a BJ's membership and Amazon Prime if that at all matters to you. 

A room big enough for a Twin XL, maybe a desk, and a table in the public area to play board games on is all I really want out of life right now.

Finally I'm looking to move around January and so if you'd like to get to know one another first then I'm down and if at all necessary I have a number of people both professional and personal who attest to my character.",2020-11-10 09:34:30

Hi! We‚Äôre looking for a roommate to join our lovely 4 bedroom, 1.5 bath apartment on Roosevelt Island! The room will be available starting Dec. 1st (earlier move-in possible), and the rent is $998.81/month with electric, heat, and water included. We only have to split Wifi and it‚Äôs $12.50/month per person (includes 60+ channel cable too), and first months rent and a $998.81 security deposit is due at move-in. We‚Äôre looking for someone longer-term, but you can move-out whenever so long as you find a replacement. You will be subleasing until August 2021, where you will have the option to join and renew our lease.

The room is a nice size and can fit a full/queen bed, a desk, dressers/cabinets, and has a closet. The entire apartment has lots of natural light and we‚Äôre right on the water (with nice views of the river), so we always have a nice breeze! We have a nice, big laundry room in the building, and the building has alternate upstairs/downstairs units, so we‚Äôre far from our upstairs and next-door neighbors and we can never hear a thing. About us: we‚Äôre three professional women in their mid-twenties to early-thirties, and we‚Äôre all really friendly, respectful, and clean. I have a very friendly 2 year old Pug mix named Murphy, and one of the other roommates has a friendly little cat- both pets stay in our respective bedrooms at all times unless they are leashed. We like to keep a clean, neat, and organized apartment, and we love to chit chat in the halls and share occasional meals. It‚Äôs generally a pretty quiet apartment, and 2 of us currently work from home during the week.

We‚Äôre very LGBTQI+ friendly, and pet-owners and smokers are welcome (as long as you smoke outside)- we just expect our new roommate to contribute to basic household chores occasionally. You just need to make about 40x the rent (give or take). We are very conscious about COVID precautions and measures, and maintain social distancing and wear masks outside of the apartment (and again, we like to keep things clean).

Roosevelt Island is a beautiful gem in the heart of NYC! A small island in the East River between the UES and Astoria, we have easy access to both Manhattan and Queens via subway, tram, car, bus, NYC Ferry, and CitiBikes. There is a ton of open, outdoor green space, with a bunch of parks, baseball fields, and soccer fields, along with open grassy fields, walking trails, a lighthouse on the north end, and the beautiful FDR Four Freedoms State Park on the Southern tip. Roosevelt Island is one of the safest neighborhoods in all of NYC, and I always feel comfortable and safe when my dog decides he needs a walk at 3 AM. There are a few local restaurants, a supermarket (FoodTown), a few smaller food markets, a Duane Reade, a Starbucks, the Post Office, and a neighborhood sports facility that has a pool. We have a super affordable parking garage if you have a car (it's about $190/month), and as the queen of take-out (I hate cooking), there are a ton of delivery options from both Manhattan (usually UES), Queens (Astoria and LIC), and Brooklyn (Williamsburg).",2020-11-07 04:36:26

We‚Äôre looking for a roommate to rent a beautiful room in our three bedroom, 1 bathroom apartment in Astoria **(near Astoria Ditmars and Astoria Blvd stops on the NW).** Move in date is **ASAP in** **November or December 1st**! Hoping to find someone who is looking to settle in and stay long term.

About the Room: Your room is the largest of the three rooms. It is 150 sqft. with high ceilings and a nice, super-sunny window! It‚Äôs the ideal fit for a Full or Queen size bed, though you‚Äôll certainly have room to spare.

The Apartment: Top floor (not basement) of a two-level apartment on a quiet block in Astoria. **A couple blocks from Ditmars and a few blocks from 30th ave**, you‚Äôll be surrounded by plenty of parks, food options and recreation.

Your roommates: 2 respectful men in their mid-twenties. Both of us have stable work and/or jobs to return to in the (hopefully) near, post-pandemic future. We‚Äôre clean, fairly accommodating and also involved in creative pursuits of our own (i.e, music)

You (ideally): Friendly, mature, accommodating, trustworthy, relatively clean, in 20‚Äôs/30‚Äôs, any gender. Have stable income or plenty saved/a job to return to soon (we know it‚Äôs tough right now). Creative is a plus!

384,[Advice] Is this another Craiglist scam? - UWS Sublease,10,joqvvb,https://www.reddit.com/r/NYCapartments/comments/joqvvb/advice_is_this_another_craiglist_scam_uws_sublease/,28,"Hi everyone! I've recently found a very good deal in the Upper West Side and it is so good I wonder if it is a scam.

This is a 1BR apt. for $1000/month.

Of course, after looking at the ad on craigslist, I had my doubts so I emailed the renter asking to meet in person. Nothing more. He replied the next day asking to meet in the morning to which I said hell yeah.

**PART I**

He gave me the apt address, I went (with fear to get kidnapped or something), and BAM! I met the guy, he showed me the place, and then we sat down in his living room to discuss.

The very first thing I needed to know was... why the price. To which he explained the following:

1. He is a filmmaker. I actually noticed his two film posters in his living room
2. He just finished his last film and now is in BIG dept
3. He rents the place for $1,800/month
4. He has a long-term commitment
5. His plan is to sublet the place for some time, while he clears his debt and moves to Brooklyn to live for free with someone close
6. His banks have closed his account so he would only be accepting cash
7. We would be signing a lease agreement

I told him I would think about it and went home.

**PART II**

I researched the dude and he is legit a filmmaker. I saw his IMDB, LinkedIn, and Facebook profile and everything is legit. I even saw how he filmed some scenes in the apartment. I won't share his name or his address because I don't want to damage his reputation by just being suspicious. 

So then I emailed him saying that I would like to make the deal but I would like to know if the landlord is aware to which he replied:

>Thank you for meeting with me and you're very friendly.  
>  
>But the more I've thought about it, you do raise a good point: I don't actually know if the landlord allows us to sublease.¬† Even though I feel no one in the building really cares, I still don't want to take that chance and have you move in only for a problem to arise a week later.  
>  
>I'd feel bad taking your money without having a clear answer, so let me get back to you.¬† But I suggest you keep looking, for your own good.

I said okay, then few days went by and:

>Hello Jessica,  
>  
>Good news, everything is set with the landlord.  
>  
>Also, I've been thinking it over, and I realize that asking for $1000 in cash is a bit extreme, and I can understand why it would make anyone uncomfortable.¬† Also if we keep up that system, it's just going to be an inconvenience.¬† Do you have CashApp?¬† That is actually the method that would work best, and we wouldn't need to meet in person every month.  
>  
>Let me know and I can start drafting something up.

And the conversation goes on. 

**PART III**

Today, he sent me a draft for the lease where he even promises to get the place professionally clean before my moving date. He is also offering me more options to pay: Paypal, cash app, and Zelle.

We agreed to meet on Saturday to sign the lease, pay, receive the keys. 

I'm planning to go with two of my best friends. 

**What should I do in the meantime?**

All these email exchanges happened through the generated line we get from craigslist. I emailed him through craigslist and he has been responding there ever since. I know that some scammers ask you for an email address or cell-phone number and he never did that. He also never asked me for money before seeing the place or meeting or signing the lease.

I currently live in the area, in a private room for $650/month. I've been here for the last two years so I know it is possible to find a good deal in the UWS. BUT, I don't want to become another scam victim so please, if you have some experiences/warning/advice that could help me, I would really appreciate it.",2020-11-05 23:54:51

Our landlord didn‚Äôt raise our rent with this renewal but we‚Äôre definitely overpaying even staying at the same rate that we originally signed at. 

Any success stories here or approaches that worked well?

EDIT: I should add my unit is rent stabilized which is why I think this may be a bit more difficult.

UPDATE: for anyone using this post as a reference, we provided links to similar units on our block going for $2100-2200. Landlord is offering us a $400 reduction for the last three months of our lease but is not budging on price or working with us on free months for our renewal.

- landlord is a special type of heinous, always has been
- completed our full lease. Gave them just short of a month to let them know we're not resigning
- moved out at the end of August, while Cuomo's executive order was still in place for tenants to use security deposit as rent. We used the security deposit to pay the last months rent
- we left the walls painted and did not paint it back (we stayed 2 years)
- some pieces of furniture and lamps remained as well as some last minute trash

After almost 60 days, they reached out saying pay up in 7 days for 2000$ or we take you to court. In our lease, it says should we go to court, we have to pay their attorney fees if they win the case. 

Does this still apply if they don't let us know within 30 days? 
What is the likelihood of them actually filling right now?
In the case that they do take us to court and they win, will we need to pay the attorney fees even if our lease is over and we owe them nothing more than what they are saying us for?

Thanks in advance for any help or information

Edit to add:
Thank you everyone for your input. Paid them and waiting for confirmation. 

In the cases where people think I'm an asshole, I just would like to add what I left out because it wasn't directly relevant. They pulled a bait and switch on us. When we moved in, there were glass shards on the floor that wasn't cleaned, live electrical wires hanging off the ceilings, missing window... Animal fur/ dust balls everywhere. Suffice it to say, it was a giant mess and we had little control over it due to the switcheroo. Like many moves in NY, we were moving out and in the same day and in the middle of summer when movers are usually booked a couple weekends ahead. It took over a month but we got them to fix most things and hired cleaners for things we couldn't clean. All of this has email trails. They charged us for water leak damage that they refused to fix during our stay. I mean I can go on. But based on your responses, and our experience with these particular landlords, we negotiated down and paid them. Waiting on confirmation from them now.

I wish there was some review board for landlords or the like. I've lived in almost 10 apartments in NY and the things they were pulling off is what landlord nightmares are made of.

The long and short of it is that me and my roommate need to break our lease and the landlord wont let us, but he will let us find a tenant or folks to fill the apartment. All you pay is first month and security deposit. Frankly, our apartment is awesome, the best part being the in-unit washer and dryer and the amount of sun that it gets.

Initially they asked for 15%, I countered at 7%, they said the lowest they take is 8.3% and now they're saying someone else offered 13% (I don't believe them as they keep trying to sell the place and offered to remove the good faith deposit). NO ONE is asking for a broker fee ATM but this one seemed like a good enough deal that I don't mind paying a broker fee but 13% seems ridiculous and they keep saying their ""boss"" needs to approve it? I always thought the broker made the call...

The broker claims it is rent stabilized. How can I verify that this unit is stabilized, and for that matter any apartment I look at? I have a document posted by the Rent Guidelines Board that lists all stabilized buildings in Manhattan as of 2018 but it doesn't seem to be accurate.

Sara and I are both clean, respectful and chill. We‚Äôve lived in this apartment for the past 3 years and we truly love it! I work in Tech and Sara is currently pursuing her Master‚Äôs degree in NYU. We enjoy cooking, sour beer, making cocktails, playing board games and watching movies together in our free time. We are both COVID-conscious, and we are seeking an equally respectful roommate.

Don't hesitate to reach out and ask any questions if you have any interest in our apartment. We can show the apartment in person or over FaceTime, whichever way you feel comfortable!

Thanks!

* Rent budget $1800 (with some wiggle room).
 
* Move date - before the year is up/Jan 2021


* Bedstuy, Crown Heights (once it's walking distance to Clinton Hill)

* Laundry in building (not in-unit, but at least in the building)

**More info about us here:**  [I posted yesterday with some apt questions] (https://www.reddit.com/r/NYCapartments/comments/jioimw/advice_receiving_various_info_on_roommate_and/?).

Looking for 1bed apt in Bedstuy (preferred) or Crown Heights (if it's close to Atlantic/Fulton St). My BF works in Clinton Hill - that's another area we are looking but I know it's out of our budget - but we would prefer if it's about 20-30 min walking to his job (he currently lives 2 blocks away from his job). I'm on bike so I don't have any specifications, but we narrowed the intended area down to Bedstuy/Crown Heights/Clinton Hill.

 We don't need to be in a trendy area, once it's safe, it's not rat infested, and the ceiling won't collapse. 




I know there's lots of covid pricing happening at the moment so we are hoping to snag a deal before the year is up.



We prefer a large bedroom and separate living room (not a living room inside the kitchen). I know it's being picky with the budget but I know a true living room exists,  I've seen listings on Streeteasy, I just prefer to go through reddit as I'm afraid of sketchy scammy listings. 




Bonus but not important - roof access/pets ok (we don't have any pets but having the option is a bonus, but not necessary). 


*NO brokers please unless the landlord is paying you, we probably already have to pay for a guarantor service.*

I'm looking for someone to take over my lease in a luxury doorman building in downtown Brooklyn.

Move in : Flexible around late Nov 2020/Dec 2020/Jan 2021. I am offering 1 month free but price is negotiable depending on move in date!! just ask :)

Lease ends : 7/31/2021. You have an option to renew and negotiate with building management for additional concessions. In the summer you generally have more options... Perfect for someone looking for flexibility with short term lease as most luxury buildings with concessions will lock you in for 14 or 24 month leases.

My apartment is brand new and my  family  was the only resident since  the unit was built. As you can see from the pictures (which i took on my iphone...) the rooms are huge, has a huge walk in closet in master, and has an amazing view of the city and brooklyn. Obviously got washer and dryer in unit, with beautiful bathrooms that have great water pressure (does anyone else care about this?). Kitchen has all stainless steel appliances with movable island which comes in handy. I am in my apt for majority of the time due to the pandemic (I WFH) and I'm always in awe of the view.. the view does not get any better than this! you can even see the ocean near JFK from my apt, in addition to all of the random fireworks that happen on the east river.

As far as the building, it's a full service building with an army of front desk, maintenance, and mailroom staff members. The building figured out the operation pretty well and it's maintained very well across the giant lobby, extensive amenities space (gym,pool,dog run, outdoor  lounge, movie room, indoor lounge, skylounge on 53rd floor). Hand sanitizers everywhere and perfect to live during the pandemic. Wholefoods is 1block away that has great delivery, and Trader Joe's is also 3 blocks away if you don't mind waiting in line. There are so many restaurant delivery options that you don't even have to go outside for days... If you do want to go outside, the building is within walking distance to bk bridge park and the prospect park.

If you need additional info, I've written in below link a detailed description about the building and the apartment!

Hi all! Thanks in advance for taking the time out to give some advice. 




My bf and I are planning to move to a 1 bed in Brooklyn before the year is up ($1800 is our max budget). We both live in Brooklyn (he with roommates, I with family) . Separately, we don't qualify for the 40x rule to live alone, but together, we do.  I have some questions that I tried to look up but I was left even more confused. I'll break down my questions below:


* Do landlords *combine* both of our income to see if we meet the 40x requirement or do they look to see if we quality separately? I'm assed out if it's the latter :( 

* He makes more than me, but his credit score is worse (pretty bad, while mine is 770+), how will this affect us, even if our combined income fits the requirements? Would he not be able to be on the lease?

* If he is unable to go on the lease because of his credit score, will the landlord require only **me** to make the 40x? Or will his income still be considered?.
We both have zero debt/ never been to housing court. Clean backgrounds. He just messed up his score when he was younger and never touched a credit card again.

* I understand it's now illegal to charge more than the 1st month and deposit, but if we **offer** to pay an extra month in rent (instead of paying for a guarantor service), can the landlords accept, or are they not legally allowed to? Does that also depend on the landlord? I rather pay for a second month than throw that money away, you know?

* Seeing all that we have/don't have, does anyone (with the experience) know if most likely we will still need a guarantor service? Or if one credit is high, and the income together meets, we should be fine?

* I'm still trying to understand this ""one month free"" and net effective rent thing, but those scare me because it seems the rent can really jump when we re-sign the lease (to compensate for the free month), any advice on those apartments? Avoid them all together?

edit: [This site on Streeteasy](https://streeteasy.com/blog/net-effective-rent-what-does-it-mean-nyc-actual-rent/) helped me understand net rent and calculating actual cost. 

* I can't provide proper tax returns because I was out of the country for the last 2 years and my current job I recently started in Sept. Do LL ask for tax returns or thats more luxury buildings?


* We plan to save about $10-12k before we move in.
(first month, deposit, guarantor/paying extra month, a few months rent saved). Would showing our bank statement and seeing that we have that money saved, would that be in our favor as well towards the landlord?


I know a lot of these questions depends on the landlords, and some smaller ones are more flexible, big mgmt will be strict. But hopefully clearing these up we can plan and proceed accordingly.  I guess that's all I have for now, the rest I can find by googlin :)



Thannnkkkkkks! Stay warm & dry today!

My hope is to live in Manhattan (with my work place being in Hudson Yards).   

What I‚Äôm trying to figure out is, with 1 or 2 roommates, is an $1800 per month doable? I can go as high as ~$2000, but I don‚Äôt want to be living rent poor. In my college town, a 1B1Ba w/  separate living room and kitchen will run about $700 a month, utilities included. A 2 or 3 person would run in the 300-600 per month range.   

*Somethingggg* tells me that the pricing is a little different in NYC, and I‚Äôm just struggling to wrap my brain around the overflow of information, particularly with all the articles about falling rent post-COVID.

\-Lots of food on 5th/7th ave! 

\-November 1stMove in! 

\-1,400.00/mo

Hi all\~\~ 

One of our lovely roommates has to move for work and we are looking for one roommate to fill in our very large first floor, 4 bdrm Park Slope apartment in a 5 unit building for Nov. 1stmove in. We're looking for kind and clean animal friendly individuals (cat friendly). The shared living space is huge, and you can share in mealtime or evening work/chill time as much as your personal boundaries allow. 

The room: This external room is the biggest in the apartment and has its own bathroom and door to our backyard! All of the rooms in the apt have high ceilings and good closet space, this room being as large as it is can easily house a queen or king bed if your heart desired. Currently there is a queen bed, dresser, end table, bookshelf, desk, and accent chair. It shares a wall with the kitchen, but no other bedrooms and feels almost like a studio. The window and door both face our private backyard that only we have access to!

We are super close to Prospect park we are just three breezy blocks from the 7th Ave F/G stop & a short walk to the R at 4th Ave/9th St. You will be sharing a fully furnished living room and kitchen (w/ dishwasher), the backyard. 

About Us: You‚Äôll have three sunny female roommates! Currently we‚Äôre all WFH but that‚Äôs temporary due to covid. Jessie is an event planner and pre-covid was often travelling. Maddy is a chill transplant from Arizona who works for a non-profit focused on providing diversity training for the sports industry. I‚Äôm a middle school English/History teacher who also runs a podcast! 

You: Currently the place is chill, clean, friendly as we often spend time together (movie nights, wine nights, etc.) We pay our bills on time so we‚Äôre hoping to maintain that. We value having a comfortable and welcoming space so looking for people with \~\*positive vibes\*\~ who can respect the space and one another. Pets (I.E. dogs) are sadly a no-go as of now (Landlord rule) but cats are okay. I have a baby Russian tortoise, and a kitten. We have also had some pet friends as overnight guests, and we love animals. NO COUPLES PLEASE (individuals will be interviewed exclusively). 

Neighborhood: Located in a pretty prime spot, not far from 5th ave which is full of restaurants, bars, etc. We‚Äôre basically on 7th ave which is a lot of shopping and food. Two Avenues up is Prospect park (and we‚Äôre very close to the coveted dog swimming pond‚Ä¶). Utilities usually come to between $50-60 per person each month and include gas, electric & internet. 

\~\*\~Requirements: be prepared to have first month‚Äôs rent w/ security, along with a $100 credit check required by our management company. Lease is for one year. Living Room and kitchen are entirely furnished (so no need for additional furniture for the most part)

\~\*\~ Attached photo is of your possible future bedroom/bathroom as well as common spaces. -Message for more info-

Hey everyone! I'm reposting this listing because we were able to get the price lowered with our management company! Yay!

Beautiful spacious master bedroom available in \~2000 sq ft 3 bedroom apartment. You would be living above Delmonaco's: the oldest restaurant in the country! Classic downtown apartment has hardwood floors, large kitchen with dishwasher and a recently refurbished bathroom. All utilities (including cable and internet) are included in the rent. All furniture in the room can be kept or removed depending on your needs. Building amenities include in-building laundry, beautiful rooftop garden and gym (once it‚Äôs available to be reopened). Move in available immediately.

You are blocks away from the 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, A, C, E, R, W, J & Z trains.

You would be living with two responsible, mature and kind roommates who are currently working from home during the pandemic. We are both men in our early 40s who work in the arts.

We keep the apartment clean, quiet and liveable for everyone, and use our large shared living room as a quiet shared work space during the day. At night, we‚Äôre often watching a few movies and TV shows or listening to old records in the living room. We sometimes do shared meals and other roommate activities and really enjoy living together. 

We‚Äôre home more often than not these days, but we are regularly over at our partners‚Äô apartments as well.

We are currently keeping a very Covid-safe apartment. We are not having visitors over other than significant others and are observing proper mask use (when out of the apartment), hand washing and social distancing protocols. Please let us know if you have any questions about this.

Dogs are very welcome in the apartment and in the building! Also you must be LGBTQ-friendly.

We know that this is a difficult time to be moving, and we want to make this process as easy and transparent as possible!

Please contact us if you have any questions or want to schedule a socially distant tour.",2020-10-23 01:31:31

We‚Äôre looking for a roommate to rent a beautiful room in our three bedroom, 1 bathroom apartment in Astoria **(near Astoria Ditmars and Astoria Blvd stops on the NW).** Move in date is **November 1st**! Hoping to find someone who is looking to settle in and stay long term.

About the Room: Your room is the largest of the three rooms. It is 150 sqft. with high ceilings and a nice, super-sunny window! It‚Äôs the ideal fit for a Full or Queen size bed, though you‚Äôll certainly have room to spare.

The Apartment: Top floor (not basement) of a two-level apartment on a quiet block in Astoria. **A couple blocks from Ditmars and a few blocks from 30th ave**, you‚Äôll be surrounded by plenty of parks, food options and recreation. Apartment is equipped with a modest-sized kitchen, kitchen table for dining and a nice, sunny living room with a TV and a couple couches. Bathroom is regular size with a shower/tub.

Rent: The room itself is **$916 a month**. In addition, **WiFi is about $16 a month** per person and **ConEd utilities usually run around $25-$75 a month per person (depending on seasonal usage etc.)**

Your roommates: 2 respectful men in their mid-twenties. Both of us have stable work and/or jobs to return to in the (hopefully) near, post-pandemic future. We‚Äôre clean, fairly accommodating and also involved in creative pursuits of our own (i.e, music)

You (ideally): Friendly, mature, accommodating, trustworthy, relatively clean, in 20‚Äôs/30‚Äôs, any gender. Have stable income or plenty saved/a job to return to soon (we know it‚Äôs tough right now). Creative is a plus!

Feel free to reach out as soon as you can with any questions you have, tell a bit about yourself and we‚Äôll take it from there! :)

Beautiful Tudor Revival Architecture and two parks makes Tudor City unique, a city within the city. Prospect Tower rises high overlooking the United Nations and the Ford Foundation, and carries the iconic ""Tudor City"" sign featured in photographs around the world. Two blocks to Grand Central, conveniently located and accessible to all forms of transportation (we even have a Citi Bike Station). A full service, 24/7 doorman building with an onsite manager, the building also features THE BEST roof deck in Tudor City with stunning views of the City and the East River! Of course there is Laundry onsite and storage available (extra fee); a full gym is available in sister building 5 TCP for $39 per month.

Apartment 621 is a rare bird for Tudor City studios - two exposures, East and South, providing light, views and air!

The apartment has been renovated with two closets and a galley kitchenette (so the kitchen isn't in the Main Living Area). The kitchenette has good storage space and features a beautiful and functional granite counter, a deep stainless steel sink with a goose neck faucet, two burner ceramic in counter cook top, a stainless steel convection microwave and an under counter refrigerator. The bathroom is beautifully tiled to the ceiling with modern lighting and pedestal sink.

Corner deli, dry cleaner and Tudor City Steakhouse occupy the ground floor commercial space of the building. Wine shop, Clothing Boutique, Tudor Garden Nails, MB Fashions (dry cleaning, maid service, window cleaning, wash and fold), Tudor Cafe, automated USPS office - a little bit of everything.

Sorry, Prospect Tower does not allow dogs. Prospect Tower is a non-smoking building. The building allows subletting (board approval required) after two years of owner occupancy. There is an assessment of $67.01 through February of 2023. Heat, water, electricity and air conditioning included in maintenance which is partially tax deductible for primary residents.

Room is $975/month plus utilities, which are typically $50-$60/month. Can fit a queen sized bed with space to spare.

The apartment is a third floor walk-up, 3 bed 1 bath. You would be sharing with two other guys in their mid 20s. We're both really chill and keep to ourselves most of the time. One of us works in fundraising, the other works in tech.

Nearby attractions include Prospect Park, the Brooklyn Botanical Gardens, the Brooklyn Museum, and Barclays Center. Only a 5 minute walk to the Nostrand Avenue 2/3 and 10 minute walk to the Franklin Avenue 2/3/4/5.

Nearby bars and restaurants include Two Saints, Colina Cuervo, Barboncino Pizza, Chavela‚Äôs, MISC, Caf√© Rue Dix, and more.

Small grocery store less than a block away, larger grocery store four blocks north of the apartment. Laundromat is right across the street.

We would prefer a nonsmoker and no pets, as one roommate has bad allergies.

502,[Advice] Deciding Between Two Upper West Side Apartments,0,jf2v6n,https://www.reddit.com/r/NYCapartments/comments/jf2v6n/advice_deciding_between_two_upper_west_side/,2,"Hello! I would appreciate insight deciding between two Upper West Side Apartments. They are both the same price.

Apartment 1: 73rd and Broadway at historic building and absolutely beautiful architecture. I live very close to here currently and find the area enchanting and gorgeous. This is probably the best possible location for me in New York City. Apartment itself is gorgeous and has an immaculate lobby and friendly staff. The apartment also has a beautiful roof and great views.

The unit itself is on a low floor and gets minimal natural light which could lead to me becoming depressed. The bedroom is immaculate and large with a spectacular ornate fireplace and spacious true walk in closet. I value this a good bit. Living room is a reasonable size but kitchen is fairly small though not by NYC standards and I like to cook. No issues with bathroom. 645 sqft

Apartment 2: West End Towers on 63rd and West End which is an okay looking building but nothing special. Lobby is nice and location is kind of meh being near only a Western beef and a solid 10 minute walk uphill to Lincoln Center.

The unit itself is on a very high floor with a ton of windows that pour in great natural light. The kitchen is large and spectacular. The living room is spacious but for someone who doesn't like to entertain more than 10 at a time that's not necessarily good. Bedroom is a good size but nothing spectacular and closet is slightly small. Big drawback here is location and big positive is the light.

Seems to be a matter of personal preference but what do folks think about these areas and respective buildings?",2020-10-21 04:57:45

2 roommates and I used to live in a 3bed apartment for a year. At the time of signing, roommate A was the lease holder and roommate B and I were on the lease as residents but not as lease holders. When we signed, roommate B and I each payed a third of the security deposit for the lease to roommate A. It was agreed that when the lease ended roommate A would return each of our security deposit. Also rent was to be paid each month to roommate A, who he would then pay the full amount to the landlord/management company. 

Now fast forward to present. At the last month of our lease, roommate B decided to discount their portion of the security deposit from their portion of the rent for the last month. Basically roommate B secured the security deposit by partially paying rent on the last month. On the other hand, I did not do that and trusted that roommate A would return the security deposit once he got paid by back by the landlord, which he said he would. Also, when we moved out, all roommates had left the apartment and roommate A had left the apartment in bad conditions/dirty so I had to make sure I cleaned and emptied the apt before I left to ensure I got my deposit back. However, it has been a month since we moved out and roommate A is not replying to my text or calls of me requesting and asking for my deposit. 

Do you think it‚Äôll be beneficial to take this to NYC small claims court? I saw that the fees are only $15-$20, but I‚Äôm not sure if it‚Äôs worth it, if there‚Äôs any other hidden costs, or if there is a chance of me winning. I‚Äôve never been or taken anyone to court, so I‚Äôm not sure what can be expected. Or are there any suggestions or alternatives anyone might recommend if they‚Äôve gone through something similar to this? TIA",2020-10-17 04:15:09

I'm looking for someone to sign a 12-month lease for my one-bedroom apartment in PLG that would start November 1. I am relocating with one month left on my lease, but you would sign a new lease with the management company vs. it being assigned to you for one month. The monthly rent is $1,650.

Details are below; please leave a comment or message me with any additional questions!

**THE APARTMENT:** It's a one-bedroom apartment up one flight of stairs in a small pre-war building with a friendly and attentive live-in super. The door opens into the hallway, with the bathroom and bedroom on the left, followed by the living room and kitchen.

The bedroom is pretty small, I believe 9x6. I fit a full-sized bed (with storage underneath, which came in clutch), tall dresser, standing mirror, laundry basket and garment rack. No closet, unfortunately.

The living room and kitchen are bright and airy, with two east-facing windows (amazing morning light) and exposed brick. The living room can accommodate a regular-sized couch, coffee table, accent chair and small desk or table. The kitchen has plenty of cabinets, but limited counter space, so I opted to use an island. If you don't care as much about the counter space, a pub table and stools would work well.

Since I am re-locating, I'm leaving a few things behind (if interested):

* Dresser in bedroom
* Garment rack in bedroom
* Faux cowhide rug in living room
* Silver standing rack in kitchen
* Teal rolling cart in kitchen

**WORTH MENTIONING:** Neither were a problem for me, but the bathroom is tiny (even by NYC standards, as you can see from the photos), and the bedroom doesn't get the best natural light. There are no closets in the apartment, so I utilized every kitchen cabinet and used a garment rack in the bedroom (in addition to having a dresser and storage under the bed). The Fios modem is wall-mounted and kind of sticks out like a sore thumb, but one could probably get creative and cover it.

Pets are allowed on a case-by-case basis. The apartment has been kept very clean and is pest free.

**LOCATION:** The apartment is located a 3-min. walk from the 2/5 trains at Sterling Street and 3 blocks from the B/Q/S trains at Prospect Park. There is an express bus stop and Citi Bike docking station one block from the apartment as well.

The neighborhood is lively and diverse with a strong community vibe. Great local dining scene with fantastic independently-owned cafes and restaurants within walking distance (Glou, the wine bar on the corner, is lovely). And of course there's Prospect Park, just a scenic, 10-minute walk away. Sad to be leaving the apartment and PLG!

**RENTAL REQUIREMENTS:** Landlord requires 40x the rent and good credit. 12-month lease, with first month's rent and security deposit due at signing.

I'm respectful and clean - not a neatnik, but I don't bring the party home; I dabble on guitar but I'm respectful about noise; and I take timely care of my dishes, my cat's litter, and trash.

**About you:** 25-45 years old with your shit at least mostly together. You shower regularly and will do your share of household cleaning. Friendly and sociable enough to hang out occasionally together in or outside the apartment. Respectful about noise. 420 and cat friendly. Looking for a long-term stay (ideally year+ / 5 months minimum).

**ABSOLUTE NOs:**  
\- Couples  
\- Additional pets  
\- MAGA hat wearers

We‚Äôre looking for a roommate to rent a **beautiful room** in our three bedroom, 1 bathroom apartment in Astoria (near Astoria Ditmars and Astoria Blvd stops on the NW). **Move in date is ASAP in October or November 1st! (If you move in part of the way through October, you won't have to pay the whole month!)** Hoping to find someone who is looking to settle in and stay long term.

About the Room: Your room is the largest of the three rooms. It is 150 sqft. with high ceilings and a nice, super-sunny window! It‚Äôs the ideal fit for a Full or Queen size bed, though you‚Äôll certainly have room to spare.

The Apartment: Top floor (not basement) of a two-level apartment on a quiet block in Astoria. A couple blocks from Ditmars and a few blocks from 30th ave, you‚Äôll be surrounded by plenty of parks, food options and recreation. Apartment is equipped with a modest-sized kitchen, kitchen table for dining and a nice, sunny living room with a TV and a couple couches. Bathroom is regular size with a shower/tub.

Rent: The room itself is **$916 a month**. In addition, **WiFi is about $16 a month per person** and **ConEd utilities usually run around $25-$75 a month per person (depending on seasonal usage etc.)**

Your roommates: 2 respectful men in their mid-twenties. Both of us have stable work and/or jobs to return to in the (hopefully) near, post-pandemic future. We‚Äôre clean, fairly accommodating and also involved in creative pursuits of our own (i.e, music)

You (ideally): Friendly, mature, accommodating, trustworthy, relatively clean, in 20‚Äôs/30‚Äôs, any gender. Have stable income or plenty saved/a job to return to soon (we know it‚Äôs tough right now). Creative is a plus!

Feel free to reach out with any questions you have, tell a bit about yourself and we‚Äôll take it from there!

One of my roommates moved out and we are looking for another individual to take his room. It is a very large room in a luxury building (security, laundry room, package room, doormen, gym, etc). We are located one block away from both the Q and 6 trains, and are only a few short blocks away from grocery stores such as Whole Foods, Fairway, and Keyfood.

The room itself is spacious and can comfortably hold a queen bed, desk, dresser, and more.

Please kindly note that our lease is up at the end of the year and we wish to re-sign - the rent will be substantially lower and as such, the rent of your room would decrease as well. The catch is that we need to re-sign the lease before the end of the year in order for this to be effective.

I am listing my bedroom in a gorgeous 3bd/2br apartment in the heart of the UES. You would be taking over my lease which ends August 31st, 2021. The rent you would be paying is $1633.33/month. PICTURE ATTACHED!

The apartment itself has brand new kitchen appliances including a dishwasher, a brand new WASHER/DRYER IN UNIT, a PRIVATE ROOF DECK and amazing light. There is exposed brick in the bedroom and the living room as well. The common spaces are already completely furnished including the deck-- all you need is a bed and whatever you'd need to furnish a bedroom! The building is well-kept with really nice, quiet neighbors!

My room is a great size for the city, I have a full bed in it but it could easily fit a queen bed with leftover space. Along with the bed I have a bookcase, a desk, a nightstand, a large mirror and more so it's very spacious with two windows and an A/C unit for free which I have already installed! It has a large closet with an overhead storage space (see photos). The bedroom will not be furnished so you can decorate it in any way you'd like!

My roommates are two awesome women in their early 20's who are working professionals. They're really sweet and a lot of fun to hang out with! They would prefer another female roommate if possible.

It's literally a steal of an apartment in such an awesome and safe location (true UES, in the 80's off a major avenue)! I have already paid the security deposit and all fees so you'd literally only have to pay rent and split utilities. Also I'm willing to negotiate and possibly help you pay for the background check that the landlord will probably ask you for.

If you're interested, message me and I can send you pictures, videos, you can FT or Zoom call me to see the place in real time!

This large room is available for rent in a 3 bedroom apartment on the 16th floor of a luxury building on the Upper East Side. I am moving out of my apartment and will perform a lease transfer so your name will be on the lease. Lease expires 12/31 with the option to extend.

This is the flex room in a 3 bedroom flex apartment. The wall in this room goes from the floor to the ceiling and features just as much privacy as a normal room. The room is large enough to fit a full or queen sized bed, desk, dresser and more. It also has heat/AC that you can control yourself and large windows with amazing views that let in tons of light. The rest of the apartment is fully furnished and has a gas stove, dishwasher, fridge with ice maker, microwave, comfortable couch and coffee table. The apartment has 1 and a half bath, the half bathroom will be yours to use exclusively.

The roommates are two young professional guys in their late 20s and early 30s. Both are very respectful and keep to themselves.

The building has laundry in basement, a doorman, package room and a gym & pool on the roof (for an extra charge, but much cheaper than NY Sports Club or Equinox). It is less than a block away from both the Q and 6 trains, as well as steps away from great restaurants and bars.

I live on the Park Slope/Gowanus border right now and my lease is up at the end of January.

I want to stay in this general area (could also be Fort Greene/Prospect Heights/Cobble Hill-ish) and I know the norm is to look for an apartment on the month your lease is up but it gives me anxiety, so posting to see if anyone is finishing their lease at the same time as me and moving or leaving the city and loves their apartment and would like to get someone who‚Äôd take good care of it to take it after them.

I‚Äôm looking for a bright, quiet 1-bedroom apartment with laundry in the building or unit, full-size appliances, tub where you can take a real bath, elevator (if the apt is higher than the third floor), pet friendly (tiny dog under 10lbs) and, if I‚Äôm lucky, smoke-free and south-facing. I can pay a max of $2500. 
If anyone has any leads, I‚Äôd be really appreciative.

I‚Äôm looking to leave my apartment (that I absolutely love) because:
- My neighbour downstairs smokes inside and I have asthma and allergies that get triggered by the smell and it just really fckin annoys me tbh
- it‚Äôs not a dog-friendly building and I‚Äôm getting a dog
- there is no laundry in the building
- the stairs are extremely narrow which  makes it a nightmare for moving furniture/groceries/laundry and I‚Äôm on the top floor (4th)

If these things don‚Äôt bother you, it‚Äôs a really great apartment with the most amazing management company I‚Äôve experienced in NY, and I‚Äôve lived in 9 different buildings in the 7 years I‚Äôve been here.

573,Advice please: Were we scammed by our landlady? Any hope of getting our broker's fee payment back?,2,j9tia0,https://www.reddit.com/r/NYCapartments/comments/j9tia0/advice_please_were_we_scammed_by_our_landlady_any/,8,"Hello all. I hope this is the right sub for this inquiry. Last December (December 2019), after a long and frustrating search my boyfriend and I found an apartment listing on Craigslist scheduled a visit. Perhaps the first red flag should've been that we were directed to a location one door down from the actual building. And the images posted for the apartment we wanted were for a different apartment. Nevertheless we liked the place and decided to take it. When we decided to take the apartment, the person who presided over the lease signing was our landlady. We were also directed to pay a first month, last month's, and broker's fee to the same company. And our rent payments have been paid to that same company.

Around the beginning of the year, we were informed by a friend that broker's fees were supposed to be eliminated. Out of exhaustion from moving and fear of drawing negative attention from our landlady/broker we didn't confront her about it. From perusing rental listings on various sites, it appears that many apartments are still charging broker's fees. I've also since discovered that my landlady is also a real estate agent. And, in fact, we have seen images of our actual apartment posted under a different address. My question is is it legal for our landlady to have collected a broker's fee? Like I said, we have been sending our rent payments to the same company as our broker's fee. Also, could we demand the broker's fee payment back?

The apartment is renovated and in the heart of Bushwick, a two minute walk from the L and many bars and restaurants (House of Yes, Seawolf, The Rookery, The Sultan Room, and many more). The building has a large finished rooftop with great views of the Manhattan skyline. The room is $900 a month (+ $900 deposit to move in) and approximately $80 per month for utilities and internet.

About us: You‚Äôd be sharing the place with three girls in their early twenties, and a guy in his mid-thirties who lives in the basement (which has a half bathroom) so you‚Äôd mostly be sharing with the three girls. We also have a cat! We're all pretty laid back and try to keep the common areas clean.

You would need to apply to be on a year‚Äôs lease, so you must either have good credit and make 40 times the monthly rent or a have guarantor. If you're interested or know someone who is, please DM and tell us a bit about yourself or if you have any questions. Thanks!

But if prices continue to fall, I‚Äôll be stuck spending more until my lease ends.

To be short, I've lived in the city for about a year and a half after moving from Kentucky for law school. However, when I did that, I had my parents helping me move and find a place. I am no longer in contact with my parents (for a variety of reasons). I will be moving from my apartment around June of next year, and I'm terrified. 

I don't know the first thing about moving or finding a place in New York. I probably won't have a guarantor because of the parent situation, and I'm living off of student loans because working while a full-time student is practically impossible. I am so nervous for when the time to apartment hunt and roommate search comes around. 

I want to find a person who is comfortable with me bringing my furniture (that we can both use) while also being aware of my financial situation. I had decent credit, somewhere around the 700's, and would be more than happy to split the security deposit and rent, but I am still terrified. 

I also don't have a lot of friends willing to help me move furniture, so I'll probably hire a moving company: another thing I haven't done. The idea of breaking down furniture alone just adds to the terror I'm feeling. 

This might sound like overdramatization, but my anxiety is through the roof with this. I'm 22 in a big city with not a lot of connections. It feels like moving is some insurmountable task I cannot do alone. Are there any tips to help ease my nerves?",2020-10-11 02:49:30

Hello\~!!!  


We have a wonderful roommate leaving to live with her partner. We're sad to see her go but are now looking to fill an empty room in our sun soaked apartment with ENORMOUS common rooms (large living room, HUGE kitchen + dining room.)  


**LOCATION:**  
It's a 4 bed 1 bath in a 4th floor walk up. 1/2 block from the Nostrand 3 train station. Also close to President 2,5 (3 blocks), and Franklin 2,3,4,5 (3 avenues), Select B44 bus to Williamsburg (2 blocks), and Nostrand A,C (12 min walk). LOTS of public transport options as you can see -- you'll never be stranded from late night train closings. 1 mile from Prospect park, and even closer to the Brooklyn Museum.  


**ABOUT US:**  
1) Freelance videographer/photographer -- 30 yrs old, he/him, philosophy major, likes to experiment with food in the kitchen on occasion, tech savvy.  
2) Service industry/Masters in Social Work -- late 20s, she/her, enjoys checking out NYC, social & amicable, happy soul, loves her bike, and keeps a very clean room!  
3) Freelance photo industry -- Early 20s, she/her, foodie, enjoys fashion, maintains clean common spaces, boxing, exploring NYC.  


**ABOUT THE APT:**  
1) Shoe free house -- we take off our shoes when walking in the apt. We have indoor slippers.  
2) CLEAN -- keeping a tidy, clean apartment is very important to us. No overnight dishes in the sink when possible, expectations to contribute to communal chores, etc. We understand people get busy, etc., and that no one is perfect.  
3) We have a large DISHWASHER!  


**ABOUT THE ROOM:**  
We actually have 2 rooms you can pick from. But we're listing what we believe is the more desirable room. You can check out both though and take your pick. The room is roughly 10ft x 10ft. The black shelves can stay ($35) or be taken down. Please excuse the super messy standing desk area... I keep a very clean common space -- my room is a different story though haha. Landlord is very mediocre -- I'd say a typical NYC landlord. You will have 3 roommates. The bathroom hasn't been an issue in the past -- usually 1-2 people are always out of the apartment. Lease is up for renewal in Oct 2021. You're invited to renew with us assuming we all get a long :) Sorry, no pets, no couples.  


Room is available Nov 1st (possibly earlier if you need/want. If you're interested, let us know a little bit more about you, what you do, and when you're available to video-call!",2020-10-10 16:28:33

We live in a 3 bedroom + 1 bathroom next to the 6 train station on 103rd and Lexington in East Harlem. Luana and I share a room, Josh is in his own, and our old roommate recently moved out, so we‚Äôre looking for 1 lucky person to fill that slot!

The room is available for move-in October 15th onward for $875 plus utilities. We split the utilities evenly (internet would be $18.75/ month each, power varies but is usually around $20-30/month each depending on how much AC we use). We will prorate rent for an October move-in.

THE ROOM is 76 square feet with a closet and fits up to a queen bed (though it‚Äôs snug). Currently it has a twin bed, a bed side table, and a fold out desk.

THE APT has an awesome big common area that opens into the large kitchen. There are windows on all sides and all rooms of the apartment so we get good light. In the past we have enjoyed having ppl over but with the current pandemic that will not be happening again for some time. But we‚Äôre pretty chill and like to sometimes just hang out together and watch dumb TV.

PERKS!
- 1 block from the 6 train
- 10ish minute walk to the Q at 96th
- 1 blocks away from several laundry places
- Grocery store (Ideal) right across the street and others nearby. 
- Amazon locker at 7-11 directly below us
- Awesome live-in super who loves us ‚ù§Ô∏è(for real, we've been here for 3 years and he's the nicest guy in the world)
- Building is generally pretty quiet 
- Lots of food in the area. Cafes, restaurants, fast food etc. 
- Nextflix, Hulu, Disney+!

US
We‚Äôre three twenty-somethings (a couple (Luana and Ryan) and our bud Josh) who just recently graduated in 2019 from NYCDA and NYU. We are all actors trying to get through this crazy time üôÉ. LGBTQI+ friendly, 420 friendly, pro BLM, we VOTE, and we take COVID very seriously and want to find someone who shares these views!

YOU
We‚Äôre looking for someone who is ideally in their 20‚Äôs as well, who is a clean, honest, responsible person. Sorry no pets (we have two dwarf rats that are ESA angels). And no couples (we just don‚Äôt have the space for another one). No smoking or vaping inside (420 ok).

DETAILS: $875/mo plus utilities. We require first months rent (prorated for an October move-in) plus a security deposit of $875.

DM me if you‚Äôre interested!! We‚Äôre down to chat via FaceTime or text!!

We are looking for a 3rd roommate to fill in for a roommate who's moving out. The apt has a master bedroom with bath, and a medium bedroom and smaller bedroom that shares a bath. This rental is for the medium bedroom. The apt has a sizeable livingroom and modern kitchen as well as washer/dryer in unit. A block away from Gantry Park with plenty of basketball courts and football fields as well as a beautiful view of the Manhattan skyline.

&#x200B;

\-Medium bedroom in a 3bdf

\-2x bathroom

\-Semi furnished, comes with 48"" TV.

\-Washer/Dryer in apartment

\-Doorman

\-Gym

\-Large game room and study room in lounge and great rooftop with view of Manhattan

\-3min walk to the 7 train (Vernon Boulevard‚ÄìJackson Avenue) and 10min door to door to Grand Central.

\-Floor to ceiling windows and great view of an adjacent park

\-Pet friendly building with pet shower rooms available.

&#x200B;

We've lived in this building for 4 years now and absolutely love it. I've lived in Manhattan for 10 years and I have to say this is the perfect spot to be as you get all the benefits of being in the city (10 mins from Manhattan) and all the benefits of not being in the city (bigger space and lower price). Gantry Park which is one block away also offers a beautiful view of the Manhattan skyline as well as basketball courts, soccer fields, running trails and dog parks. Great food choices from Chinese to Peruvian all within a 5 block radius.

Rent:

If you are interested in the smaller bedroom for a lower price we can also do that as the current roommate is open for a swap.

Effective rent: 

$1422 ($1600 with 1 month free, 9 months on lease) for medium bedroom

$1244 ($1400 with 1 month free, 9 months on lease) for smaller bedroom

Utilities are generally $25 for internet and $50-$70 for electricity, everything else is included.

Move in Oct-18

Lease runs until 7/31/2021 but will consider shorter term stay.

&#x200B;

Current Roommates: 2 male young professionals. We are quiet/respectful of each other and keep the apartment very clean but also easy going and friendly so you'll have no issues with us.

We're Mike, Mac, and Brian, three dudes whose many shared passions include cooking, assorted nerd standards (Star Trek, Cowboy Bebop, Firefly...), maker-culture, urban gardening, and backyard fires. We live in a 4br/2ba apartment right by the Halsey JZ station in Bushwick. Our fourth roommate got laid off due to current events and is sadly moving home, so their room will be available from Nov 15th onward for $750/mo with all utilities included. A November move-in is totally cool and the rent would be prorated for that month.
 
**THE ROOM:**
The room is 110 sq ft, and features a closet and sliding doors. The room comes furnished at no extra cost, and you are welcome to discard anything that you don't need or want. It is in the center of the apartment, so it stays very quiet.
 
**THE APT:**
This place is huge! The kitchen and living room comprise the main common area, and we have a large, private yard in the back with a fire pit and grill. Mike maintains a lush garden during the warmer months, so there‚Äôs a reliable supply of tomatoes, hot peppers, and basil. We have two adorable cats, but at this time cannot accommodate any more animals. In non-pandemic times we enjoy hosting periodically, but generally prefer not to take the party home, as we are grownups and like home to be a respite from this very loud city.
 
**PERKS:**
+ 2-minute walk to the Halsey JZ, 15-minute walk to the Wilson L stop
+ As mentioned, we have a grill/smoker and fire pit available for use
+ The upstairs neighbors are friendly, quiet, and considerate
+ There are several, excellent groceries stores in our immediate vicinity, as well as many excellent bars, restaurants, and laundromats within easy walking distance
+ The apartment is just off Broadway, but far enough down the street that it is very quiet
+ We have a piano, if you're into that sort of thing
+ Actually fast Internet
+ Spacious, well-stocked kitchen with a robust set of appliances
+ We have Netflix, Disney+, and Amazon Prime, and you are welcome to use them
 
**US:**
We are three, 30-something guys who work in creative and technical spaces. We are LGBTQ+-friendly, 420-friendly, vegan-friendly, pro-BLM, and we vote. We take Covid-19 very seriously and are looking for someone who shares our concern. 
 
**YOU:**
If you‚Äôre kind and responsible things will work out great. Other than that: Be clean. Be honest. Be employed. Be solo (sorry, no couples, no pets, no fascists). Be rad.
 
**DETAILS:**
Rent is $750/month. We require the first month‚Äôs rent (prorated for a November move-in) plus a security deposit of one full month's rent upon move-in. No indoor smoking or vaping.
 
**ALRIGHT SO NOW WHAT:**
Send us an email and tell us about yourself! We can give you a video chat walkthrough, or we can have a socially distant, responsible chat in the backyard.

November Availability. 2 Roomies currently.",18,j6w557,https://www.reddit.com/r/NYCapartments/comments/j6w557/room_share_one_bedroom_streetoverlooking_bay/,0,"Hey! This is Brian & Pete, we're two artists looking to get a third roommate to fill in for a previous roomie who had to leave due to a family hospice situation. We're pretty content to keep to ourselves, but are also both generally chill and quiet people. We live in a 3br/1ba apartment located above a store in Bay Ridge. The rent for the room is $650/mo, plus utilities (which averages out to about 100 bucks most months per person.) A November move-in would be helpful, but we're open to negotiations. 


The Room is facing the street, unfurnished, but the second largest bedroom in the apartment. I (Brian), lived in that room the first few years I was in NYC; it is large enough to comfortable fit a twin mattress, a desk, and other basic furniture (see link/attached photos if I can figure out how to attach photos). It can, also fit a queen mattress in an exceptionally cramped way, but if you're into that it is possible. There is a radiator heater, and it is the furthest room from the two of us so you'll have an additional bit of privacy from the two of us going about our days. It is living room adjacent, but we're not really hosting parties or anything like that for obvious reasons.


The Apartment itself is rather large, specifically the living room and dining area. The kitchen is really more of a kitchenette, but it suits our purposes well enough. We're located a few blocks from the R-Train, two blocks from grocery stories, next door is a bodega which has most things; its a pretty decent location for getting what you need and where you need. 


About us; we're a couple of mid-late queer individuals who are ostensibly looking to get out of NYC within a year or so. If you want a starter apartment situation in the city, this is your chance; we're open-minded, LGBTQ+ friendly, and we're taking COVID-19 seriously; as in addition to normal reasons I've lost several people to it already and just don't have time for bold fools or fascists clogging up our bandwidth. 

Tl;dr: 

* Rent - $650/month. 
* Utilities - ~$100/month. 
* Security Deposit - $650. 


Ideally we want someone for a good while, and we'll give ample notice (like, 3 months notice) if we plan on getting out of NYC. I'm graduating from grad school next summer, so our earliest out would be Autumn-ish; and that's assuming the world isn't as on fire. If you just want to pop in for a few months while something else gets figured out, we'd appreciate a 3-month minimum commitment.

The apartment is very conveniently located, walking distance to numerous bars and restaurants, laundry and a 24h convenience store on the corner, and a 24h grocery store across the street.  About an 8 minute walk to the M,R, and sometimes E trains at 46th ave. Q18 bus stops right outside.

626,[Advice] Subletting an apartment,1,j5s0nn,https://www.reddit.com/r/NYCapartments/comments/j5s0nn/advice_subletting_an_apartment/,2,"To All,

I'm working for a real estate firm right now, and I'm trying to list some of our apartments. My idea is that we can list apartments, separated by room, and find roommates that would fill up the apartment. Would this be possible to do on r/NYCApartments? Would anyone be interested in that? We have a few three and four bedrooms in UES that we are trying to fill out.

If you have roommates and are moving please feel free to inquire!

Thanks a bunch.

628,[Need Advice] Should I be the guarantor for a friend?,3,j5nl3d,https://www.reddit.com/r/NYCapartments/comments/j5nl3d/need_advice_should_i_be_the_guarantor_for_a_friend/,6,"I have a good friend who, unfortunately, is a ""musician"" / music producer, and as such has never really had consistent or on-the-books income. He's also never built up any sort of credit history. He has cash saved up, probably $10,000 worth, so he's not broke - but all his money comes from freelancing, gigs, side hustles, etc.

I've know him for a good 7-8+ years and consider him one of my best friends, but obviously there's risk involved with someone that has no ""real"" income (although he DOES make a living and has been paying rent with a roommate for many years).

For personal reasons he really needs to move out soon, but he's been struggling finding anywhere since he has no verifiable income/credit history. I offered a possibility that I might be able to act as his guarantor (i have good income & credit), but would want to charge a premium to make it worth my time (and risk) - which he agreed to.

He is looking to pay $750 - $1000 for a room and has another roommate looking to pay the same, so budget is around $1500-2000 for them both for a 2-bedroom apartment. I figured an apartment around $1700 would be fair, and I would charge them $2000 for my ""services"" - so I'd make a little extra cash to take on this risk. (This price range opens up plenty of locations in Queens/Brooklyn, where they prefer).

Any thoughts on if this is a good/bad idea? Obviously my only risk is if somehow my friend, or his roommate, are no longer able to pay in which case I'd be stuck with filling a vacant lease/transferring the lease... But I'm confident my friend should be able to pay. For the record, I don't know his roommate, although my friend tells me he DOES have on-the-books verifiable income (just bad credit).

(PS - My friend is even willing to pay 2-3 months in advance, to secure a location, so ""funds"" aren't an issue - they are just having a hard time finding anyone willing to even take 2-3 months rent in advance without a credit history)",2020-10-05 21:20:05

We're Mike, Mac, and Brian, three dudes whose many shared passions include cooking, assorted nerd standards (Star Trek, Cowboy Bebop, Firefly...), maker-culture, urban gardening, and backyard fires. We live in a 4br/2ba apartment right by the Halsey JZ station in Bushwick. Our fourth roommate got laid off due to current events and is sadly moving home, so their room will be available from Nov 15th onward for $950/mo plus utilities. A November move-in is totally cool and the rent would be prorated for that month.
 
**THE ROOM:**
The room is rather large at 196 sq ft, and features a closet and three tall bay windows that face northwest for great afternoon light. The room comes furnished at no extra cost, and you are welcome to discard anything that you don't need or want. There is radiator-style heating and the space stays pretty cozy, and also comes with an AC unit. This room is the furthest from the common areas and tends to be the quietest.
 
**THE APT:**
This place is huge! The kitchen and living room comprise the main common area, and we have a large, private yard in the back with a fire pit and grill. Mike maintains a lush garden during the warmer months, so there‚Äôs a reliable supply of tomatoes, hot peppers, and basil. We have two adorable cats, but at this time cannot accommodate any more animals. In non-pandemic times we enjoy hosting periodically, but generally prefer not to take the party home, as we are grownups and like home to be a respite from this very loud city.
 
**PERKS:**

* 2-minute walk to the Halsey JZ, 15-minute walk to the Wilson L stop
* As mentioned, we have a grill/smoker and fire pit available for use
* The upstairs neighbors are friendly, quiet, and considerate
* There are several, excellent groceries stores in our immediate vicinity, as well as many excellent bars, restaurants, and laundromats within easy walking distance
* The apartment is just off Broadway, but far enough down the street that it is very quiet
* We have a piano, if you're into that sort of thing
* Actually fast Internet
* Spacious, well-stocked kitchen with a robust set of appliances
* We have Netflix, Disney+, and Amazon Prime, and you are welcome to use them
 
**US:**
We are three, 30-something guys who work in creative and technical spaces. We are LGBTQ+-friendly, 420-friendly, vegan-friendly, pro-BLM, and we vote. We take Covid-19 very seriously and are looking for someone who shares our concern. 
 
**YOU:**
If you‚Äôre kind and responsible things will work out great. Other than that: Be clean. Be honest. Be employed. Be solo (sorry, no couples, no pets, no fascists). Be rad.
 
**DETAILS:**
Rent is $950/month, and utilities generally work out to about $100/person during peak usage. We require the first month‚Äôs rent (prorated for a November move-in) plus a security deposit of one full month's rent upon move-in. No indoor smoking or vaping.
 
**ALRIGHT SO NOW WHAT:**
Send us an email and tell us about yourself! We can give you a video chat walk through, or we can have a socially distant, responsible chat in the backyard.

I live in Greenpoint currently and recently moved from a walkup a few blocks away. My EX landlord is refusing to give me my security deposit back because he says there has been substantial work being done on the apartment and he is also putting in a new stove. He is threatening to send me a bill as well for the work. My questions are what are my options in regards to getting my deposit back? I'm definitely not paying a bill if he sends it to me. Some other info for context

1. The stove when i left the apartment was still working and I even scrubbed the stove top to get rid of grease spots to the best of my ability.
2. I swiffered and swept before i left and spackled the few holes from nails I used to hang up stuff. Aside from the basic wear and tear I left it in the shape I moved into.
3. He is basically charging me to put in a new stove when he never offered to replace them during the 3 years i lived there.
4. I never missed rent when I lived there.

My upstairs neighbor also saw the state of the apartment when i was mostly moved out and she can confirm it was fine.

When texting him about my security deposit he responds with

""Actually it‚Äôs a bill I‚Äôll be sending you

Quite a bit of work including a new stove

Sorry""

And I follow up with

""

I‚Äôm very surprised by this as I‚Äôve had no heads up or any communication since I‚Äôve left regarding any issues with the apartment. Please send an itemized list and pictures of issues with the apartment.""

and his next response is

""

I‚Äôll send you cancelled checks

You have an obligation to return the apartment to the condition you found it

That‚Äôs why there‚Äôs security

Did you ever clean it?""

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

EDIT:

I sent a formal email requesting an itemized bill of things they used to fix the apartment with photos of receipts. Also noted that i left the apartment with a functional stove and cleaned myself. Now will wait for his response. ",2020-09-30 00:50:10

Our dear roommate had to unexpectedly leave the country and so we're looking for a cooperative, kind, relaxed, responsible, clean person to sublet the rest of the lease, with a flexible start date anytime from now to November 2020. The lease ends August 31, 2021.  


The room:  


We've got a room with a south-facing window that easily fits a twin size bed and a desk, and separate closet across the hall. The room is unfurnished and is ideal for someone who lives a minimalist lifestyle (though it has a twin sized mattress and frame if you want it, as well as a wardrobe closet).  


The location:  


The apartment is located in a leafy Clinton Hill neighborhood, on a quiet tree-lined street (and the room advertised here does not face the street, so it's extra quiet). It's about a 10 minute walk to the Clinton-Washington Avenue G train stop. It's about a 3 minute walk to several different bus stops that take you to downtown Brooklyn, and/or the A/C/F trains (Jay/York Street) and the B/Q/R line (DeKalb Ave stop) in about 10 minutes. It's also close to Myrtle Ave, which has tons of grocery stores, laundry facilities, and restaurants, and Fort Greene Park is about a 10 minute walk which has a Farmer's Market on Saturdays.  


The roommates:  


We're relaxed, friendly working professionals (a male structural engineer, a female software engineer in training) in our late 20s and early 30s who like to live in a peaceful home. You can find us spending our free time either reading, or studying French. We're peacefully quiet people who greet each other in the hallway and respect each other's space, and comfortable with communicating issues collaboratively in person. We are also mindful of practicing regular hand washing when returning home, mask wearing outside the apartment, and social distancing guidelines to protect ourselves and each other from COVID-19 and would expect our future roommate to do so too.  


We're looking for:  


\* Cooperative, peaceful, and kind personality  


\*Someone who is responsible about washing their hands regularly at home upon returning, and follows guidelines to protect themselves from COVID19 outside of the home (social distancing, wearing masks, reducing exposure).  


\* Non-smoker of any kind. This is a drug-free apartment.  


\* Employed professional who works regular hours. If you are working from home, you are mindful of how much noise you make, and how your presence will impact others who are also working or studying at home.  


\* Cleans up after themselves regularly (eg. keeps the kitchen sink free of dirty dishes. We do not leave dishes to ""soak"")  


\* Willing to participate in a bathroom cleaning schedule  


\* Non partyer and non party-hoster. Keeps social life outside of the apartment. Our apartment is a peaceful place to rest after a hard day's work. No overnight guests.  


\* No pets  


\* No couples  


\* At most an occasional cook (kitchen space is limited)  


The rent is $844 per month and utilities + internet run about $55 per person per month and we pitch in for any household items as well (\~$20/month for toilet paper, etc). We will require a security deposit of one month's rent as well.  


If this sounds like a good fit, please include in your message:  


\- Name and profession, general work schedule Mon-Fri  


\- link to your LinkedIn profile  


\- Age  


\- Phone Number so that we can set up an initial phone chat to see if we're a good fit  


\- A little about your lifestyle at home (frequency of kitchen use and habits), and what you like to do for fun

My roommates and I are looking to fill our two front rooms ASAP for the new lease starting November 1st. The apartment is renovated and in the heart of Bushwick, a two minute walk from the L and many bars and restaurants (House of Yes, Seawolf, The Rookery, The Sultan Room, and many more). The building has a large finished rooftop with great views of the Manhattan skyline. The first room is $900 a month (+ $900 deposit to move in) and the second room is $925 a month (+ $925 deposit to move in). Utilities and internet are approximately $80 per month.

About us: You‚Äôd be sharing the place with two girls in their early twenties, and a guy in his mid-thirties who lives in the basement (which has a half bathroom) so you‚Äôd mostly be sharing with the two girls. We also have a cat! We're all pretty laid back and try to keep the common areas clean.

You would need to apply to be on a year‚Äôs lease, so you must either have good credit and make 40 times the monthly rent or a have guarantor. If you're interested or know someone who is, please DM me and tell us a bit about yourself, or if you have any questions. Thanks!

Everything has actually been great‚Äîour landlord lives downstairs, and it‚Äôs the only building he owns. We love the place. There‚Äôs only 4 units including his‚Äîtwo studios on the middle floor (we‚Äôre in one), and a couple upstairs.

However, when I first contacted the broker, my first message asked if dogs were allowed‚Äîthe broker said yes. When we showed up to view the apartment, there was a dog in the front yard, so we didn‚Äôt even question it again. However, on lease signing day, upon going over the lease, I realized it said no pets allowed. I asked why I was told dogs were allowed‚Äîthe landlord who says the broker never even asked his pet policy said he would be fine with any pet other than a dog. He explained the dog in the front yard was his girlfriend‚Äôs who lives in Albany, and he just doesn‚Äôt like them. This was very close to being a dealbreaker for us at the time, but the price of the apartment was too good to pass up in this current economy, so we went forward.

Fast forward to now, I‚Äôm pretty sure the landlord‚Äôs girlfriend lives here (her name is now on the mailbox), and her son is even moving into the studio next to ours, which means.... her dog lives here and we have to watch her play with it every day and wonder why we can‚Äôt have our own.

Would it be unreasonable to bring it up again? I was thinking of approaching him when our lease is up and say we will probably have to move if we can‚Äôt get a dog. Has anyone been in a similar situation?",2020-09-24 03:54:01

Just didn't know how much the market has really changed.

I'm about to re-sign my current lease and I really am not looking forward to another year in here. I hate my roommate, she hates me back, and because of COVID we're stuck at home together. In addition, one of our other roommates isn't renewing, and we have had literally no interest in our ad (probably because of COVID, it wasn't ever like this before) so instead of the rent being split between 4 people it is now split between 3. I did the math and the new amount I would pay in rent would roughly be $1350. Which would be getting close to my income meeting the ""40 times the rent"" mark.

So given that I'm going to be paying that much anyway for an indefinite period of time, I was wondering whether it would be possible to find a studio at this price. I'm not thrilled about paying this much at all, really, but if I have to I might as well be by myself, if possible. (I don't want to move to another roommate situation which will probably turn out to be also shitty. Plus I work from home now indefinitely and people in my experience hate that.)

A few days' search suggests that there are a few places, but none have been great. I did look at one place last weekend but the broker turned out to be extremely shady (surprise) and there were other red flags, so I didn't sign. I don't expect anything huge -- my room is microscopic right now anyway -- or luxury at this price, or even nice. But I was wondering if ""fine"" exists.

Ideally it would be in Queens since my boyfriend lives there and seeing each other right now is really expensive because of cab fare (because of his living/health situation we'd rather not take the subway during COVID). But I've heard that actually makes it harder than Brooklyn or Manhattan because of supply?

(My credit is excellent, I have proof of income, I don't expect to have any trouble being approved. Finding a place to be approved for is another story.)",2020-09-22 00:01:04

I've never posted a listing on Reddit before, but this is probably my third time changing roommates in this unit. Everybody keeps moving in with family. You know. New York.

I've been in this apartment for years on a month to month lease considered long-term for a while with random roommates. My most recent one, though very chill, respectful and cleanly, decided to leave NYC to save money. So, here I am...looking...again.

Logistics:

\- No living room- Inward facing bathroom- Nice kitchen with large window- Second floor unit- 10'x10' square room- No couples. (Strictly specified by landlord; one tenant per room.)- One block from Halsey J- 10 minute walk to Halsey/Wilson L- 10 minute walk to C train (Absolutely forgot which station\~)- Laundry around the corner.- Quiet building. Safe neighborhood.- Lots of bars/restaurants/cafes- Two blocks from grocery store.- One block from Rite Aid/All the fast food in the world- First and last/security to move in.

I'm a relatively quiet young millennial guy; a bit of a geek, into pop culture, sarcastic, witty and randomly knowledgeable. I'm very cleanly and cook a lot; usually home in my room - musician, composer working mostly from home now especially because of Covid. Introverted extrovert, if that makes sense. I only drink socially and don't smoke anything; an international expat with the United Nations mix of friends and languages.

Looking for someone with a chill demeanor who is tidy and considerate.

If you're curious about me, rn my primary project is my band at [www.nihiladmirari.com](https://www.nihiladmirari.com), but I also have solo work found at [www.noshicurry.com](https://www.noshicurry.com)

And yeah... If you're interested, lmk.

\*AC unit not included. Additional cost to offset increase in electric bill for the month because Coned plays no games.

We‚Äôve been here almost a year, and like the space...but we started getting bed bugs in March. It took several inspections for them to finally confirm the pests, and we got a fumigation treatment done in July. 

Three months later, and these fuckers are back. Fortunately, we haven‚Äôt got bit but we‚Äôre finding them near the front door and in our living room closets. An inspector/exterminator came today, confirmed they‚Äôre back in, and is requesting we get another fumigation treatment. 

My partner and I *really* don‚Äôt want to move (time and major costs) but we also can‚Äôt deal with bed bug treatments every few months as they‚Äôre exhausting and require the entire apartment be bagged up. Dealing with bedbugs is also super traumatic. 

The bed bug disclosure they sent for a renewed lease lists more floors that have had them than last year‚Äôs disclosure. We absolutely feel it‚Äôs a building wide issue. 

Any advice is appreciated as we are both very exhausted from handling it. Thanks!",2020-09-20 08:38:32

I need some help determining if my lease terms are shady or if I'm overthinking things. I have been a long time renter from a property management company, but have decided to move to a building rented out by an individual. I found the unit through Streeteasy and coordinated with the landlord's broker, but I don't have a broker of my own.


The apartment I applied and was approved for was for gross rent of $3,295 a month, with one month free rent. The lease is to start on 10/1, with the free month on month 12.

Today I got the lease agreement and things don't seem to be adding up. The lease term is 11 months, starting on 10/1 and ending on 8/31. Part of me wants to think that this is due to the the free month on the tail end, but if our lease ends on 8/31 I would assume that means he can kick us out on that date. In addition, the ""annual rent"" is list as $39,540, which indicates 12 payments of the gross rent. Since we agreed upon one month free, this should be ~$3,300 less.

Beyond that, they gave us a rider to sign that says that the gross rent is actually $4,095 with a monthly credit for $800. The language states that they can increase next year's rent based on that amount, not the gross rent we negotiated. Again, not sure if this is normal or a shady practice.

I guess what I'm trying to find out is if I'm getting got, or if this is standard practice. Definitely feels shady, and will likely be pushing back to amend the points I outlined. Thanks for any help!",2020-09-17 04:38:57

We're planning to spend some time with my husband's family in Spain and we're looking for a lease takeover for maximum flexibility.

**Location**

* Upper East Side / Yorkville
* Our building is 235 E 95th St, right on top of the 96th St. Q train station at 2nd Ave. The subway entrance is so close that we usually don't even bother opening our umbrellas when it's raining. You can also get the 6 train at 96th & Lexington, which is 2 blocks away but our complex spans 2nd Ave to 3rd Ave so if the weather is bad, you only need to be outside for one block.
* There's a 24-hour Rite Aid downstairs, which is super convenient
* Close to Central Park, Randall's Island (via the footbridge at 102nd St), Carl Schurz Park, etc.
* Lots of great restaurants and bars in the neighborhood
* Relaxed and friendly vibe

**Apartment**

* Large true-one bedroom apartment (\~675 ft¬≤)
* Faces south so you get a lot of sunlight! Large windows in both the living room and the bedroom.
* We're on the fifth floor, which we love because it's easy to take the stairs down if you don't want to wait for the elevator and we're often the first stop on the elevator coming back up.
* Large pass-through kitchen looks into the living room and has counter seating and full-size stainless steel appliances (fridge with water and ice dispenser, dishwasher, stove, microwave)
* Living room is huge (12 ft x 24 ft) ‚Äî we have an office area with two large desks for working from home, a living space, a dining area, and we keep our two bikes and (way too many) assorted skateboards out here too.
* Bedroom is also huge (11 ft x 16 ft)
* Plenty of closet and storage space throughout the apartment (two closets in the hall, two in the bedroom, separate linen closet, three large medicine cabinet mirrors in the bathroom, etc.)
* Full-sized bathroom has a tub
* Central air and heat

**Luxury Building Amenities**

* 24-hour concierge and doormen
* Package room
* Roof-top health club and amenities floor, which includes a pool, large gym with multiple rooms of cardio machines and weights (fitness classes are included!), steam and sauna rooms, two large sun decks with lounge chairs, a lounge that can be rented for parties, awesome views, etc.
* Children's playroom
* On-site attended parking with direct access to the building
* Our complex uses ""BuildingLink"" so it's easy to request repairs, leave instructions for the front desk, get package notifications, reserve amenities, etc.
* The large laundry rooms downstairs use reloadable cards, and there's a website where you can check which machines are available (honestly we‚Äôve never even used the website since we‚Äôve never had to wait for machines)
* There are a couple of internet options; we use Verizon Fios.
* Building is pet friendly!

**Price**

* Currently asking for $2,650 (equal to 1.5 months free, negotiable)
* Lease goes until June 26, 2021
* The rent listed on the lease is $3,266 and you must make 50x the monthly rent on the lease in order to qualify for the lease takeover. Guarantors must make 80x the monthly rent on the lease.
* Apartment can be furnished or unfurnished
* Water and heat is included in the rent
* You'll have to pay for internet and electricity

**Timing**

* We have flexibility with timing and are ideally targeting a lease takeover between mid-October and early-November.

My family has been renting in Queens for 10+ years, and my parents are now trying to move to the suburbs. I currently work full-time in Manhattan and commute 3 hours a day. Moving to Long Island would make my commute an estimated 5+ hours, and increase my transportation costs by $400/month or so with the LIRR. I earn about $2200/month. I don't have a car, so I use public transport. I have about 10k in student loans that I am still paying off. My income is steady and I've only been full-time at my job for four months. I'm fine living with roommates and I don't spend much (especially since I am currently living at home). I just don't want to move out and crash and burn.

Is it possible to find a decent living space below $800/month? I've really only been checking the Roomi app but if anyone has other resources or life advice or really anything, I'd really appreciate it.",2020-09-15 18:47:56

So after searching and searching I finally found a room in New York City. Not the best place, but great for my financial situation. I feel like the person I'm renting a room from is taking advantage of me and my situation. The lady I rent the room from has restricted my access of the bathroom from 3x a week (including shower/toilet usage) to now 1x a week. I cant use any of the appliances in the kitchen and cant receive mail at this place? Is there any legal way to get out of this? It has really caused my mental health to decline and I cant take it anymore.

To everyone saying I need to stand up for myself, I‚Äôve been trying, but after being beat down for so long in life I don‚Äôt know how to anymore.

813,[Advice] Reasonably priced cleaning service- disgusting roommates,1,is8al5,https://www.reddit.com/r/NYCapartments/comments/is8al5/advice_reasonably_priced_cleaning_service/,4,"Hi. 

Share an apartment with 3 other late-20s women, and they are disgusting. The apartment was clean when I saw it, but I think the previous tenant that I subletted from was the one cleaning it. My room is basically studio sized and I have my own fridge, desk to prep food and eat on and food storage cabinets in my room, and have only been using the kitchen occasionally to bake chicken or to wash my dishes at night when it‚Äôs cooler out (no AC in kitchen). 

I‚Äôd like to actually use the kitchen now that it‚Äôs cooler out and the indoor temperature is tolerable, so I went in during the day yesterday (I usually use it after dark). It is FILTHY. Every single shelf and drawer of the fridge is covered in brown/golden sludge material and it smells, the cabinet under the sink is covered in black mold from a leaky pipe (that they haven‚Äôt called maintenance for), the cabinets are sticky inside and out, the microwave is awful, the floor is covered in some type of gold-ish sticky substance, and it‚Äôs filled with boxes of food lying around everywhere (it seems like they buy food in bulk, because the freezer is crammed with meat). 

We only share 2 common spaces- the kitchen and a small bathroom. I‚Äôve been thoroughly cleaning the bathroom and shower/tub every week because they won‚Äôt- they don‚Äôt even take out the bathroom trash when there‚Äôs flies in it (and I don‚Äôt know what the actual hell they‚Äôre putting in the trash that it fills up every week, just flush your fucking toilet paper). 

I‚Äôm going to deep clean the entire kitchen tonight, with the $50 of cleaning supplies that I bought, because I‚Äôm being a responsible and normal adult and calling maintenance in the morning to check out the kitchen sink leak. But I work full-time and I‚Äôm enrolled in grad school full-time, and I can‚Äôt keep the kitchen, bathroom, and hallway clean and livable on my own. We tried using a weekly chart for just taking out the trash (because they don‚Äôt take out the trash even when it‚Äôs overfilled- they just take a new bag and put it on the floor), and the trash room is literally 45 seconds down the hall. I use my own full-sized garbage can in my room for everything as a result, including food, because I physically can‚Äôt take out the kitchen trash- my roommates are all from China and cook authentic Chinese food, and leave the onions, fish, and fish sauce in the garbage can for days at a time in hot weather, and it literally made me vomit. 

All that to say, I think I need to hire a cleaning service to come in every other week to clean the bathroom and kitchen. I don‚Äôt think my roommates are going to agree with this and chip in to cover the costs, they seem really cheap- one of them bought drain cleaner for $4.50 and requested $1.13 on Venmo from each of us. And they‚Äôre obviously just fine living in filth like pigs- even the fraternity houses at my old SUNY school were cleaner than their kitchen. I really want to be able to use my kitchen that I pay for and can now use with the cooler weather, but I can‚Äôt keep up with their messes. 

Anyone have any recommendations for reasonable cleaning services? We‚Äôd only need bi-weekly or even monthly and it‚Äôs a very small kitchen and bathroom. We‚Äôre on Roosevelt Island if that makes a difference. Despite my absolute disgust and frustration, I‚Äôm going to continue to live here, because it‚Äôs an incredible room at an incredible price in the only neighborhood I‚Äôm willing to live in.",2020-09-14 02:31:08

Thanks so much, everyone, for your kind words.  I'll miss living here and I hope the new person takes good care of it!

&#x200B;

HUGE, BRIGHT, SUNNY, QUIET, PRIVATE! Basically this place is just great. Take this beautiful one bedroom apartment from me. I'm having to relocate to Arizona rather abruptly and told my landlord I'd help find a new tenant for the apartment. Hopefully that's you!

Link to Craigslist posting with photos: [newyork.craigslist.org/que/apa/d/maspeth-amazing-bright-updated-1/7195254665.html](https://newyork.craigslist.org/que/apa/d/maspeth-amazing-bright-updated-1/7195254665.html)

üåà üêæ LGBTQ friendly, BIPOC friendly, pet friendly! üåà üêæ

My cute cats are not included with the apartment. <3

It's a two story building on a quiet residential street somewhere on the border of Maspeth, Bushwick, and Ridgewood. Two apartments downstairs, two apartments upstairs. This one is upstairs (the one with the wreath, in the photos). Windows on both sides of the building, overlooking the street from the bedroom and the downstairs tenants' garden from the kitchen. You can do what I'm doing today and have the bathroom, kitchen, and bedroom windows open to get a wonderful cross-breeze going and it's all I need on beautiful fall days.

The kitchen gets good morning sun, and the bedroom gets that beautiful golden hour glow in the evenings. There's a radiator in the bedroom, living room, and bedroom. I bought a big ol' window unit for AC and it works great keeping the bedroom cool, and a fan in the doorway pushes that cool air through the rest of the place easily. I don't need my AC unit so I'm selling that as well ($400, originally $490 and only 2 months old) and can leave it in the window if you take it!

As you can see, this place is great for plants. Your quarantine children will thrive here. Cats are welcome, dogs are unlikely to be accepted but I'd encourage you to ask the landlord if you want an exception. No pet rent, no pet deposit -- just be a good and responsible human. Also please spay/neuter your pets. Bob Barker thanks you.

The photos show half the apartment painted white and half still its old yellowish color -- it will all be fresh and white by the time you move in. The previous tenants seem to have had very creative children who expressed themselves freely on the walls, and I think whomever was cooking also took the same liberties with creativity. I've deep cleaned nearly everything at this point and it should be fresh and feeling brand new by the time you move in!

The neighborhood is mostly hispanic and Polish, and there's a great bodega right across the corner. McDonald's up the street if that's your jam, but really all you need to care about is Bella Donna pizza. Walgreens is within easy walking distance, and the very nice and very big laundromat is just a couple blocks up on Metropolitan. Trains are a little distant, but the buses are very close and take you right to the train lines in no time! It's about 10 minutes by bus to the Jefferson L. Easy bus ride to go play in Bushwick.

The apartment is available October 1st, but move-in date can be flexible within a few days.

There's no tricks, no catches. This place really is just a gem. Any questions, or want to come see it? Text or call my Google Voice number! 503-208-5120. I'll be available pretty much any time. Thanks, and welcome to, uh, Bushridgepeth!",2020-09-13 06:17:59

I'm looking to take advantage of the current rent incentives to move into a place of my own, preferably a Jr./true one bedroom in an elevator building. I would like to be near the WTC area if/when we are allowed back in the office. I'd prefer the neighborhoods listed above, but also open to anything along the West Side   Highway up to Midtown.

Looking to keep it under 2100/month net (preferably with the option to pay net effective every month). A private balcony is on my wishlist, but understand that's a tough ask at this price point. If anyone has any leads, it would be greatly appreciated!

As a side note, does anyone have any experience with the Bouklis group? Their yelp reviews seem very suspect, but they seem to have a monopoly on the cheaper ""luxury"" apartments in Fidi.  


Edit: I'm dumb, current lease is up 10/31 so looking to move in near the end of October/November 1. Thanks!",2020-09-13 03:52:44

What does concern me a bit is that there is a section in my lease about accepting the apartment ""as is"", though it does have some wording about a walk-through inspecting by the tenant prior to move-in.

837,[advice] document processing fee of $200 on top of $20 application fee - is that legal?,7,iqqwwr,https://www.reddit.com/r/NYCapartments/comments/iqqwwr/advice_document_processing_fee_of_200_on_top_of/,21,"Hello, 

&#x200B;

I moved into this apartment I really like but I didn't really like the agent (it was no fee listing though). He charged $20 for application fee and $200 for ""document processing fee""... 

I didn't really bother haggling the $200 fee since I really wanted this apartment but now that i moved in, I'm going to ask for $20 refund since I provided my own credit report that he took. 

But what about the $200 document processing fee? All he did was really printing all the lease paper really. Legally I know application fee should max $20 but should that also include document processing fee? 

I'd rather complain to him and get my money back than report him somewhere and burn the bridges since he has a close relationship with this building management. I'm just wondering of the legality of his charges to make a sound argument.

I've gone down to Atlanta for Covid times but am trying to sublet out my bedroom in a 2-bed 1-bath in Astoria, right off the 30th avenue station! Amenities include a walk in closet, dishwasher, new gas stove, and a first floor room on a very quiet street.

Looking for as quick a move in as we can work out, and am flexible on the length of your sublease, but longer is better and can go through the end of next January (If you want to resign the lease I'm sure you'd have first dibs!)

The bedroom is very large, about 14'x12'. I am able to comortably fit a full bed, large dresser, computer desk, and cat tower (the cat is with me in Atlanta, not in the apartment) with plenty of leg room.

All of my furniture is still in the apartment and I can give you the space either furnished or unfurnished (if furnished the rent would be higher, we can figure it out).

Roommate is a quiet, clean, and friendly 23 year old male who likes playing video games and reading. He is friendly and we've had no issues with cleanliness, sharing any common spaces, or noise.

I'm sorry these aren't the best photographs, but they're what I have of the unit from when I toured and before I came down to Atlanta.

The room will be available on October 1st or can be prorated for later move in. The roommate that is moving out is willing to sell bedroom furniture if needed.

Fully equipped kitchen. Huge open living room has large bay windows that overlook the pedestrian plaza on Newark Avenue. Tons of shops, restaurants, laundry and grocery options along the same street. Storage space available in room next to kitchen.

Looking for a responsible roommate that wants to enjoy the nearby amenities and transit but also doesn't bring the party home. Amazing space and location for the price- won‚Äôt last long.

&#x200B;

I moved to an apartment I really like but the agent (no fee) was very annoying. He charged me $20 for the application fee and $200 for document processing fee. 

&#x200B;

I know $20 is the standard for app fee/credit check but since I provided my own copy of credit report instead of using the link he provided I was going to ask him for [the refund of $20](https://www.dos.ny.gov/licensing/pdfs/DOS-Guidance-Tenant-Protection-Act-9.13.19.pdf). 

But is there any way to ask for the refund for $200 document processing fee? I didn't bother haggling at first but just deal with it later on. I wonder if $200 is technically legal? All he did was literally just printing the lease paper and passing to the rental management company.. I'd rather get all my money back from him than reporting him somewhere. 

Any advice is welcomed! Cheers",2020-09-11 10:10:44

Two of the roommates used their deposit for last month's rent. Myself and one other roommate are the only ones who are to get our deposits back. 

I have reached out via email to make the landlord aware of the fact that since he did not give me an itemized list of what was to be deducted from my security deposit, I am to receive the entire deposit in full, [per this law that was passed last year](https://www.nysenate.gov/legislation/laws/GOB/7-108). 

Landlord finally responds but arbitrarily deducts $50, and also states that he will need confirmation from all other parties on the lease to confirm that my portion is the right amount. This is obviously a delaying tactic as one of the roommates is stuck out of the country due to covid and has been unable to communicate. I sent him back the roommate agreement all four of us roommates signed confirming how much our portion of the rent is.

If I do choose to take him to small claims court, how much on top of the security deposit amount can I ask for in damages? The deposit was $800. I'm planning to sue for double the deposit amount if he continues to delay. Is there a law about the upper bound?

This large room is available for rent in a 3 bedroom apartment on the 16th floor of a luxury building on the Upper East Side. I am moving out of my apartment and will perform a lease transfer so your name will be on the lease. Lease expires 12/31 with the option to extend.

This is the flex room in a 3 bedroom flex apartment. The wall in this room goes from the floor to the ceiling and features just as much privacy as a normal room. The room is large enough to fit a full or queen sized bed, desk, dresser and more. It also has heat/AC that you can control yourself and large windows with amazing views that let in tons of light. The rest of the apartment is fully furnished and has a gas stove, dishwasher, fridge with ice maker, microwave, comfortable couch and coffee table. The apartment has 1 and a half bath, the half bathroom will be yours to use exclusively.

The roommates are two young professional guys in their late 20s and early 30s. Both are very respectful and keep to themselves.

The building has laundry in basement, a doorman, package room and a gym & pool on the roof (for an extra charge, but much cheaper than NY Sports Club or Equinox). It is less than a block away from both the Q and 6 trains, as well as steps away from great restaurants and bars.

I've had several roommates since then, but the current one has become a complete nightmare that I do not want to live with any longer, can I move out without facing legal consequences from the landlord?

They have been able to find work for the past month but have yet to catch up on rent. They have also become increasingly hostile and making it a completely uncomfortable living situation.

892,[advice] Apartment Hunting in NYC: A New Way,153,imwxwq,https://www.reddit.com/r/NYCapartments/comments/imwxwq/advice_apartment_hunting_in_nyc_a_new_way/,21,"For the ten years I‚Äôve been in NYC (and much longer before that), landlords have chosen to set their rent prices according to what the market will bear, dare I say beyond. I‚Äôm a capitalist and NYC is a costly place to live so I‚Äôm not mad at landlords for continuously raising rent in a high demand, competitive marketplace. 

Having said that, the pandemic has set the city on a course toward a housing crisis due to those who haven‚Äôt paid rent and are set to be evicted. In addition, anyone who is indefinitely working from home and has the means to leave NYC is doing just that. Who would want to be confined in one of these shoe box apartments all winter, paying thousands of dollars in rent when they can be in a spacious home in a place that has no cold season? For those of us who were rationalizing the cost of living in NYC because of our jobs and its robust offering of leisure activities, being in the Big Apple is simply a bad deal nowadays. I would guesstimate this somewhat surreal downturn of this great city to last at least until spring 2021. If you have an opportunity to peace out, I would recommend it. I wish I could. But my work is an in-person sorta gig and I‚Äôm stuck here, looking for a new apartment in which to live.

In my 10 years in NYC, I‚Äôve lived in 8 different apartments. Needless to say, I have some familiarity with the apartment hunting process. What I see at this very moment heading into Autumn 2020 is an opportunity for tenants to break these landlords of some of their sidewinding tactics they‚Äôve imposed on us for so many years. 

If this paradigm shift is going to work, then we need to band together as tenants and strictly adhere to these 3 policies:

NO MORE BROKER FEES- I‚Äôve only paid a few in my lifetime but this is the most egregious extortion of NYC tenants in the whole apartment hunting process. From here forthwith, this is a non-negotiable for me. I tell any broker I speak with that a paying a broker fee is out of the question. We all need to take a stand on this one and not hesitate to walk away from nice apartments with broker fees.
NEGOTIATE THE LIST PRICE- In a high demand marketplace, we have no leg to stand on when we try to negotiate. Now is the time. There aren‚Äôt people lined up to fill out applications for $2400 studios just because they have exposed brick and the shower isn‚Äôt in the kitchen. I‚Äôm a bad negotiator. I genuinely feel bad asking for the price I think is fair. I‚Äôm doing it now. Every time. 
NO MORE NET-EFFECTIVE DEALS- I hate concessions. A month or two free the first year, making the Net-Effective Rent seemingly reasonable yet the Gross Rent remains hiked. Then in year 2, with no free months, you see a substantial increase in your annual rent cost and are stuck between paying more than you‚Äôre comfortable with or having to move again. Either tell the broker/landlord that you want the the Net-Effective Rate to be the Gross Rate or just negotiate the Gross Rent down to a number that you‚Äôre comfortable with. Bottom line, concessions or not, drive the Gross Rent price down. 

In the current state of the market, the vacancy rate of apartments has been climbing month on month. There is no reason to settle for the fees and price gouging that‚Äôs become the norm in the apartment hunting process in NYC. 

The rebalancing of the Tenant-Landord relationship will only succeed if we can prove to the landlords that we‚Äôre willing to pass on their apartments and continue searching for a fair deal. It‚Äôs a game of chicken. If enough of us pass on these bad deals, the landlords will realize they need to reevaluate their approach to finding quality tenants. All they want right now are tenants who can pay rent every month for the full term of the lease. It‚Äôs our turn to set the market and sign leases that aren‚Äôt eating up half of our income. 

As I continue to search for my new home, I‚Äôve been shocked at just how entrenched landlords are in sticking to their gouge-tactics. Then I realized that they‚Äôre just doing what they‚Äôve always done and aren‚Äôt going to change until we as tenants stand our ground. If we band together, we can break these bad habits right now and forge a more cohesive landlord-tenant relationship. It‚Äôs glaringly obvious that Rent in NYC has gotten completely out of hand. 

The last thing this city needed in the middle of a battle with this pandemic was a mass exodus of a significant amount of its young, hardworking middle to upper middle class citizens. I‚Äôve not done any studies, but I‚Äôm confident that the primary reason they all left was their rent was just too damn high and completely impractical to their financial/personal quality of life and well being. 

Even though I believe in capitalism, I don‚Äôt believe in taking advantage of people, especially when they‚Äôre in a bind. I understand that landlords have bills to pay too. I don‚Äôt think we as tenants should be bending them over the barrel, but half of anyone's monthly income on rent for 350 sq ft. is TOO DAMN MUCH. 

It‚Äôs time to push the landlords to pay broker fees and significantly reduce rent per sq. ft instead of offering bogus concessions that allow them to maintain an unreasonable Gross Rent price. If we don‚Äôt, then when this city makes its comeback, we tenants might as well just assume the position over that barrel to be plundered all over again. 

Band together on this. Let‚Äôs create a sustainable rental market where people won‚Äôt go running away from the city when the going gets tough. Less money on rent means more money into local businesses and an economy that could really use the support right about now. Happy Hunting.‚úåÔ∏è",2020-09-05 11:19:49

Currently going through a rough breakup and trying to get out of our apartment. We aren't breaking our lease, we're just moving out early. Our lease is up Oct. 1 and we'll be out of the apartment by the end of next week.

I know Cuomo extended the laws about allowing you to use your security deposit as rent but that was contingent upon a repayment plan for the security deposit. I want to see if anyone out here as any experience using your security deposit as the last month's rent.

The apartment is in good condition, I have no reason to believe we wouldn't get the security deposit back but due to our situation, I have no desire to prolong communication with my ex and would rather just leave the apartment and be done with all of it. Especially considering we'll be living in different states and don't want to have to rely on the postal system to be getting this check back.

I've contacted our management company which, true to form, has been vague and been shuffling me around to different departments so I can't get a clear answer.

909,[LISTING] 3 bedrooms ($1075/$1200/$1300) available in conveniently located Park Slope 5 BR apartment (1 year lease),0,im03dh,https://www.reddit.com/r/NYCapartments/comments/im03dh/listing_3_bedrooms_107512001300_available_in/,0,"Hello!

As per the title, I'm currently residing in a 5 BR apartment with 3 bedrooms freeing up come September 1st in Park Slope, Brooklyn. I'm going to try to include as much info as possible here to save us both time, so bear with me!

Some quick info for you:

* This is a 1 year lease, having officially started September 1st and ending August 31st.
* The three rooms are different sizes and different prices: the first (approx 10' x 10') is $1075/mo, the next (approx 9'2"" x 10') is $1200/m, and the largest (approx 15'8"" x 10'7"") is $1300/mo. The pictures below will be posted in that order.
* The first room has 2 closets on either side of the room (and thus has less open floor space, hence the lower price), and the second has 1 closet.
* The apartment has one large walk-in closet (8' x 6') off the main hallway that is shared among all of the roommates with plenty of storage space and a clothing rack bar/shelf combination that lines 3 of its walls.
* There are 2 bathrooms, one a bit larger than the other, both with showers and the smaller one with a tub.
* The kitchen is approx. 16' x 9' with a dishwasher AND washer/dryer (!), and the living room (which faces the front of the building and gets a ton of light with a great view) is approx. 15' x 15', which will remain furnished with a couch, TV, coffee table, speakers, etc.
* Utilities (electricity, gas, internet) average about \~$80 a month though this obviously varies depending on the season and personal habits; heat is included.
* Usual NY requirements for renting: 40x income rule, 80x with a guarantor. You will be subject to a credit check etc etc., all the usual fun stuff. This will be done through the landlord, which is something we'll arrange if you've decided you're interested.
* A deposit (one month's rent) is required.
* Pets are up to the landlord's discretion - you'll need to discuss that with him separately.

Who we are:

* 2 males, 1 recently graduated Film major and the other working full-time as a draftsman (me). 23 and 30 respectively. We're both working from home at the moment and are observing all necessary pademic-era precautions.
* I've lived here for a year and my other roommate has been here for about 6 months or so.
* In normal, non-pandemic times, both of us are relatively social and often hang out in common areas to watch a movie, work, cook, etc. Having said that, neither of us are noisy or intrusive and we try to stay as respectful of each other's space as possible.
* Both of us are neat and clean and freely chip in on house tasks without needing to be told to do so. We like to think of this as a small community rather than a group of strangers being forced to tolerate each other.

Who you are:

* Ideally, you share the same desire to live in a space where we can all be friendly, openly communicate, and actively keep the place clean so that everybody can freely use the space without needing to be reminded that you are, in fact, living with other people.
* Not a party animal. This does NOT mean you don't drink etc. etc. - it DOES mean that you're conscientious of the noise you're making and how it impacts other people around you and that you're not constantly having people over. 

Some info about the location: the apartment is a less than 5 minute walk from Atlantic Terminal (and thus the LIRR)/Barclays in addition to being within 10 minutes or so from the B/Q 7th ave, the G at Fulton and the C at Lafayette. The immediate surrounding neighborhood is lovely, with tree-lined streets and brownstone apartments in addition to the plethora of trendy bars and restaurants on both 5th and 7th - personally I rarely stray too far from the neighborhood when I go out because I've never felt like it was necessary with how many interesting options there are, all easily accessible on foot. We've also got a Key Food 2 blocks away, the Target and Best Buy at Atlantic, an excellent 24 hour convenience store around the corner, a barbershop and a salon down the street, several gyms \~10-15 minutes away, and pretty much every other convenience you can think of.

Please DM me if you're interested/want to know more and we'll carry on the conversation by whatever your preferred method is (phone, text, email, etc). Now, the pictures! Thanks for reading, and be well!

A little bit about myself: I am a 22M engineer who works for  large online retail company in New York City! I currently commute from Connecticut, and I work in all five boroughs. This means that commuting is a HUGE pain in the ass sometimes (like waking up at 4am to commute three hours to Staten Island...).

I adored the apartment when I moved in, and I still love it. However, with the current rent prices, I can find apartments significantly nicer (even a one bedroom) in my neighborhood. What is even more frustrating is that two of the same apartments (albeit on the first floor, I'm on the fourth) were rented out a week ago for $400 less than mine (the entire building is pretty much same configuration with same square footage, such minor differences such as if the fridge is less than a year old or not). I understand first floor apartments being cheaper (first floor usually rents $100 less a month than higher floors), but $400???

My lease is up in March 2021, so theoretically if COVID is still a pandemic and people are still fleeing NYC, the rent drop could still remain (I hope). However, I am really interested in checking out the market right now. Unfortunately, my management will not let me break my lease and said I have to keep paying rent until my lease ends, or find another tenant to take my place. I already tried emailing and texting my broker, but no response (it's only been 24 hours so I'll give it another day before I try emailing/texting again).

I know the safe way is to just stay put until March, especially since I already paid my last month's rent and they do have my security deposit. I know moving isn't cheap. But if I'm paying $400 more than the two new tenants in my building, I'd rather put my money in a nicer apartment. Besides seeing if I or my broker can find a replacement tenant, is there any other way out of this? I don't want to lie and say I lost my job and refuse to pay rent. I'll sacrifice my security deposit if I have to, but not at the expense of paying months of rent when I'm not in the apartment, or dealing with serious legal consequences.

TL;DR: landlord won't let me break my lease and says I either have to pay until the lease ends, or find a replacement tenant and I don't know if there's any other options.",2020-09-03 01:33:44

They respond to me with one studio that is out of my price range. So I let them know and asked if that was the only studio they had available and if they might have any less expensive units (long shot, I know, but I wanted to ask).

I get this reply:

936,[advice] Issues concerning neighbor next door smoking - I dont want her smoking in her room at all,9,ikjb3i,https://www.reddit.com/r/NYCapartments/comments/ikjb3i/advice_issues_concerning_neighbor_next_door/,23,"Hello,

I just moved into a new apartment I really like. However There‚Äôs this one issue I didnt foresee. The neighbor next door is a chainsmoker but has been living in this building for almost 10 years. 

It apparently didnt affect the previous tenant at all and no one told me about this. The building isnt smoke-free building. Im also the only neighbor who‚Äôs wall is adjacent to hers to notice this problem. 

Ive told my management about her smoking in her balcony affecting me (it‚Äôs connected) and they said it‚Äôs not allowed in common areas so they gave her a warning but she will be able to to do in her room. 

The problem is I think her smoking in her room seeps right through the wall, ventilation, whatever airway opened through windows and as a sensitive person I can smell in my room all the time. I couldn‚Äôt sleep well last night as I could smell the aroma..I can‚Äôt stand this cigarette smell at all in general and am concerned this is going to be an on-going issue. I‚Äôd also be concerned for the second hand smoking health problems. 

What is my best option here? Given she‚Äôs long been doing this at her home, me a new neighbor suddenly asking her to not smoke in her room might agitate her. I dont have any solutions to offer to her other than telling her go outside the building to smoke. Is this a fair ask given smoking causes health issues? Optimally I dont want her smoke at all in her room because I can sense it anytime she does this... from my room and the hallway. 

Im getting really stressed from this as I just moved in..

My lease was up in June. They tried to raise the rent 8%. I negotiated down due to Covid and they came back still with an increase but a smaller 1% one. I decided to go month to month since everything is so uncertain. I always pay rent online about 4 or 5 days before the 1st. I logged in and got a note saying they are not accepting rent from my account. Had no way to pay. I contacted them in writing saying I want to pay my rent but they disabled it. They won‚Äôt give me a mailing address. Said checks are not accepted. The only way they would restore my access is if I sign lease renewal with an increase! Given the current rental market where even in our complex they are offering 3 mths concessions to new tenants and tons of ppl haven‚Äôt paid rent due to unemployment, I was surprised they won‚Äôt accept my rent. I asked if I could get a concession or rent reduction to renew. They said no. I said i would get back to them. 2 weeks later they serve me with a 90 day notice to vacate! Saying they are not renewing my lease. So what should I do now? I always paid on time until I was blocked from paying. I have a security deposit with them. I didn‚Äôt want to renew at those terms plus they wanted me to renew with a guarantor company that charges a fee of 1 mths rent. What should I do?",2020-08-30 02:16:16

971,Seeking advice on Lease in NYC,11,iidxl7,https://www.reddit.com/r/NYCapartments/comments/iidxl7/seeking_advice_on_lease_in_nyc/,2,"Question regarding a rent stabilized apartment during these crazy times.  Prior lease was July 2019 - June 2020.  Lease was renewing on July with slight increase, so we proposed to the landlord no increase at least through October, as we have not been living in our apartment since March.  The leasing company was agreeable to this, but we never signed a new lease or sent a confirmation email.  As a result, it's been my understanding that we've now been on a month-to-month lease. 

Fast forward to now and we were considering moving to a new apartment, effective 10/1.  We contacted our leasing company to inquire on the general process of us moving out (we didn't mention we've been looking for apartments) and they are telling us that if we move, we will be breaking our lease.  They are indicating that we are under an assumed lease of our prior lease terms because it's a rent stabilized apartment.  They are telling us we would be subject to a 2-month penalty and I'm assuming we would also lose our security deposit.  The only thing they are willing to accommodate is us moving to another one of their rentals (they have tons of apartments in NYC) without any additional costs.  

Do we have any leverage here? Due to the times, they are obviously playing hardball.  My concern is that at a minimum, we will lose our security deposit ($2,400), which sucks, but my larger concern is that they will come after us for the penalty costs. 

Thoughts would be appreciated.",2020-08-28 23:40:01

We are two males in our mid-late thirties, a graphic designer and a nurse. Some qualities we look for in a roommate: considerate, respectful, clean, generally quiet, not too many guests. Healthy lifestyle. Mature and responsible. No cats but we would consider a small dog. No couples. If interested please send us an introduction. Some social media would be appreciated. Thanks and best of luck!

Work is drying up and once the project I'm on is over there's nothing else. So I'm looking to find a subletter or lease take over. How long has it taken to find someone to take over or sublet? Also where besides here is a good place to post an available room? How easy is it to do not being in the state? Are there brokers that work with rooms? I've spoken to my land lord and even though I offered to pay for two months and the broker to break the lease, he's refused and says he'll only let me out if I find someone to take over. I'd really rather not go down the route of losing my job and him still holding me to the lease.",2020-08-25 23:20:17
