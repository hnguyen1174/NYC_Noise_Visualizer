The apartment is located on Ocean Avenue across from Prospect Park and is a two minute walk to the BQ trains, they location could not be better. Living across from Prospect Park is amazing especially if you are a runner or someone who needs some nature and space. It's great all seasons.

The apartment is a two bedroom and the rooms are located on opposite sides of the space. My roommate works from home as an audio engineer and is away till mid January. He does have a small chihuahua and dogs are permitted.

I am staying in Provincetown, Massachusetts for the winter and need to fill my space. The apartment could be sublet though September 2021, although I would absolutely consider shorter options.

We have been adhering to covid practices and of course expect the same. Would love to find a queer/gay person to fill the space, but anyone is welcome of course.

The Rent price includes all utilities.

You can practice ANY time of the day/night 24/7 on gorgeous completely rebuilt Steinway O by The Klavierhaus, hold concerts-solo or chamber music, rehearsals, teach, or hold master classes right in your own room. Now, available from March 1 2021

---Hi, Manhattan UWS near Columbia University, beautiful safe neighborhood, secure 24/7 doorman Pre-War elevator building, OWN private bedroom, with PRIVATE SEPARATE ENTRANCE from me, both to the apartment itself, and to the room, and it would be like having 2/3 the apartment to yourself, very much like having your own private studio apartment, except for sharing full kitchen, dining, and bathrooms, and, IF YOU ARE a CLASSICAL PIANIST or a MUSICIAN, it's dream place for you! You can practice ANY time of the day/night 24/7 on gorgeous completely rebuilt Steinway O by The Klavierhaus, hold concerts, rehearsals, teach, or hold master classes right in your own room. High floor 15th, beautiful view of Empire State building, some view of Hudson river and the East side, quiet, high enough away from the street noise, and very sound proof enough that we won't hear each other even with doors open, me, classical professional violinist, unless we purposely go to the other side of the apartment. Yes, that far away, that private, and that sound proof. It will even be hard to know whether each other is even in.

Long term sublet. MINIMUM 3 MONTHS to hopefully YEARS, longer the better, flexible dates, no fee

Interns, students (including INTERNATIONAL), musicians, dream for pianists, all welcome (I am internationally recognized classical concert violinist and professor, but you won’t hear me, if you close your door). Interns, students (including international), musicians, dream for pianists, all welcome (I am internationally recognized classical concert violinist and professor, but you won’t hear me, if you close your door).

I'm looking to sublet the bigger of the 2 private rooms (the room in the first picture with piano. Now, the full size bed is hidden behind a room divider) which used to double as my guest room, the concert hall, and as my music studio, for LONG term with flexible dates, for male/female (it wouldn't matter because I am on one end of the apartment, and the sublessee would be on the opposite end, completely separated by the kitchen and a hallway to the bathroom, with separate entrance) non-smoker. The only pic that is not here is my own room which is at the opposite end of the apartment from the room here shown with the piano-the room which I am subletting. There are some additional chairs along the wall (used to be my music, concert room) not shown in the picture, because they are on the sides of the wall behind the door.

The occupancy is for SINGLE OCCUPANCY only (periodic visitors including overnights are of course fine but no residencies). No illegal drugs or smoking of any kind, and MUST TAKE SHOES OFF upon entering the apartment.

It is a huge, fully-furnished own private lockable room with gorgeous view of Broadway (beautiful view of the Empire State building) and the Hudson River. The room is bright and sunny and simply HUMONGOUS: 12'9"" x 24'5""!

The apartment is located on the 15th floor of a 24-hr doorman elevator building, steps away from Columbia University. This is an amazing neighborhood with great supermarkets and restaurants. The 1 train and buses 7, 11, 4, 5, 60 and 104 are readily accessible. And if you're a runner or a park lover, you will especially enjoy the apartment's proximity to Central Park and Riverside Park. If you are a pianist or musician, it is dream come true with the optional unlimited use of the newly rebuilt Steinway O Grand Piano for extra $25 per month (can practice at any time of the day, very soundproof)

Must supply me web-links (i.e. LinkedIn, Facebook etc.) which will tell me as much about yourself as is possible and/or references.

The rent is all inclusive at $1760 except for the use of the Steinway Grand Piano (available for extra fee as above)

- Fully-furnished own room 12'9"" x 24'5""!, with a full size bed
- Wireless and Ethernet Internet
- basic antennae TV
- Air Conditioner
- Washer and Dryer in the APARTMENT (as long as it lasts)
-- Private SEPARATE Entrance with much privacy. You will be on one side of the apartment, and I on the other side, completely separated by the kitchen and a hallway to the bathroom, it will be like you have 2/3 of the whole apartment to yourself
- IJoy massage chair (as long as it lasts)
- FULL use of the kitchen and utensils, share bathroom
- ALL utilities included

The room will be available for long term rental. A deposit of one month’s rent and the first full month's rent, in addition to any partial month rent, if entered mid-month, is required in cash to move in. Subsequent payments can be personal check or cash. If interested, please email me and arrange for a viewing. Only serious inquiries please.

Sublet is minimum 2 weeks or the whole month of January. Also probably some weeks in February are available too.

I live in the lovely, and very friendly part of Williamsburg. My place is close to Williamsburg restaurants, bars, music venues, and McCarren Park! But its very very quiet by us. We have a very homey, clean, creative and chill space with a yard and beautiful plants inside. Feels more like a Florida house than an apartment!

The 2 rooms are identical in size, fits a Queen size bed, a dresser, and a small desk. It also comes with a large 2 door closet that’s a rare find for a room in NYC. Windows are huge and both are facing the front of the apartment with tons of natural lighting. Once you move in, the room with be completely unfurnished and cleaned for you to have a fresh start.

Preferably short term (3 months) or month-to-month with the option to extend. My current budget is $750/month with a move-in date of February 1st 2021. I would prefer to live with other female roommates but I am open!
I am in my early 20's, I am at the beginning of my career and am so thrilled to be in the city 🙂 I am very friendly, kind, clean, and respectful - I work in the nonprofit realm and enjoy volunteering, being creative, and trying new things and food. Please message me know if you have anything available, I would love to meet you and see if we would be a good fit!",,2020-12-23 11:29:43.000000,,,,,11,10,0,,,1338135866,[]

It was a little tricky to fit the cover on because our sofa is so heavy and we like moving our sofa a lot so it was a little tricky trying to make sure that the feet of the sofa were still exposed. Honestly it’s really an affordable option and it looks really nice once it’s all put together. There are little Styrofoam tubes that you push down into the creases of your sofa in order to make it “shapely”.
